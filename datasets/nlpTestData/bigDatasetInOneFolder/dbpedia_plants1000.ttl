dbpedia:Ixia	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"The genus Ixia consists of a number of cormous plants native to South Africa from the Iridaceae family and Ixioideae subfamily. Some of them are known as the corn lily. Some distinctive traits include: sword-like leaves, and long wiry stems with star-shaped flowers. It usually prefers well-drained soil. The popular corn lily has specific, not very intense fragrance as vegetables. That is why it's often visited by many insects such as bees. The Ixia are also used sometimes as ornamental plants.The genus name is derived from the Greek words ixias, meaning \"the chameleon plant\", and physis, meaning \"bladder\"."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cotyledon_(genus)>	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Cotyledon is a genus of the Crassulaceae family. Plants in the genus occur in the Arabian peninsula and throughout the drier parts of Africa, but mainly in Southern Africa. Members of the genus are shrublets, generally succulent, with fleshily woody, brittle stems and persistent succulent leaves. The leaves are opposite. Leaf pairs generally are oriented at 90 degrees to their preceding and following pairs, as is common in the family Crassulaceae, but the leaf habit differs from say Tylecodon in which the leaves are borne in spirals and are deciduous. The flowers are pendulous and tubular, borne at the tips of stout, rather long peduncles, mainly in short cymes. Calyx 5-partite, corolla 5-lobed. Petals united in a tube or urn that generally is longer than broad, their triangular tips more or less pointed and recurved, 10 stamens arising from corolla near base and projecting or nearly projecting from the corolla. Gynoecium comprises 5 carpels, nearly or quite free, each carpel tapering into a slender style with an obliquely capitate stigma. Each carpel contains many small (typically less than 1 milligramme when ripe) globular, brown seeds.Until the 1960s there were about 150 species described as being in the genus Cotyledon. However, since then it has been split into at least Adromischus, Dudleya, Rossularia, and Tylecodon, leaving probably less than two dozen species in Cotyledon. Of these, about four are characteristically fynbos plants.Most plants in the genus, as well as those that formerly were included in the genus Cotyledon, are poisonous, even dangerously poisonous. Some have been implicated in stock losses among goats, pigs and poultry. However, many species have long been used in traditional medicine. They have been applied for many purposes, ranging from magic charms to removal of corns (allegedly successfully). One thing that is clear is that the species vary in their activity, ranging from allegedly edible to deadly, so it is best to regard all species as dangerous until otherwise demonstrated. As succulents go, Cotyledon spp. certainly are rewarding garden and indoor subjects, practically independent of irrigation in all but full desert conditions, though they cannot survive poor light or bad drainage in the wet. Their main enemies are sucking bugs, members of the suborder Auchenorrhyncha such as the mealy bug (Pseudococcus) and similar insects. Though not spectacular, they are elegantly decorative and often interesting in shape. The inflorescences of the larger species often make fine components of dried arrangements in floral design.

These flowers are commonly known as Lisianthus flowers.They are herbaceous annuals, growing to 15 \u2013 60 cm tall, with bluish green, slightly succulent leaves and large funnel-shaped flowers growing on long straight stems: sometimes erect single stems, other times growing on branching stems that can rise to be three feet tall. The flowers can grow up to two inches across and can be found in a variety of colors. They have been found in all shades of pink, purple, white, and blue. In addition, some are bicolored and some are occasionally found in yellow or carmine-red.Lisianthus flowers are either single-flowered or double-flowered. Both types of flowers can be found in all ranges of the possible colors listed above.They are usually one to three feet tall, although there are dwarf varieties that only grow up to eight inches in height. Lisianthus flowers are tricky to grow and require some maintenance. They have tiny seeds that must be sown on the surface, not buried, and they must be planted in rich, well-drained soil and exposed to full sun. They must be kept moist but not overwatered: overwatering may result in the growth and development of fungal diseases. Lisianthus flowers will begin to bloom in early summer and some will continue to bloom throughout the later months of the summer. When cut, Lisianthus flowers can last anywhere from two to three weeks in a vase.Eustoma russellianum is particularly popular and has a number of cultivars that are grown for the cut-flower market. The cultivated flower is also often known as Lisianthus, Texas Bluebell, Prairie Gentian, Tulip Gentian, or just Gentian, although the last name can cause confusion with the related Gentian plant genus. Eustoma is named after the Greek words eu, which means beautiful, and stoma, which means mouth. Lisianthus on the other hand comes from the Greek words lysis, meaning dissolution, and anthos, which means flower."@en .

dbpedia:Guettarda	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Guettarda is a plant genus in the family Rubiaceae. Most of these plants are known by the common name Velvetseed. Estimates of the number of species range from about 50 to 162. Most of the species are neotropical. Twenty are found in New Caledonia and one reaches Australia. A few others are found on islands and in coastal areas of the Indian and Pacific Oceans.Three species (G. odorata, G. scabra, G. speciosa) are known in cultivation. Guettarda argentea provides edible fruit. The type species for the genus is Guettarda speciosa. It is a tree of coastal habitats, up to 18 m (59 ft) in height. It is grown as an ornamental.Guettarda was named by Linnaeus in 1753 in his book Species Plantarum. This generic name is in honour of the 18th century French naturalist Jean-\u00C9tienne Guettard.The genus Guettarda is much in need of revision. Molecular phylogenetic studies have found it to be several times polyphyletic with some of its clades paraphyletic over small genera."@en .

It is therefore often used for sweet wines, which are considered to improve with cellaring. Ortega wines have aromas of Muscat and peach and are high in extract.Ortega is also used as a table grape.In 2006, there were 686 hectares (1,700 acres) of Ortega in Germany, with a decreasing tendency.

It lives on moderately wet soils preferable on Andean slopes from 500\u20131100 meters (1600\u20133500 ft).It grows up to 30 m (100 ft) high, with a trunk up to 2 m diameter (6.5 ft). The leaves are linear to sickle-shaped, 15\u201330 mm long and 2 mm broad. The seed cones are highly modified, reduced to a central stem 2\u20134 cm long bearing 1-4 scales, each scale maturing berry-like, oval, 10\u201315 mm long and 10 mm broad, green maturing dark purple, with a soft edible pulp covering the single seed. The seeds are dispersed by birds, which eat the 'berries' and pass the seeds in their droppings. Seeds are very difficult to germinate. Straight and cylindrical trunk. Gray and shine bark.Before the genus Prumnopitys was distinguished, it was treated in the related genus Podocarpus as Podocarpus andinus. It has also been treated by some botanists as Prumnopitys spicata (Molloy & Mu\u00F1oz-Schick 1999); however this name is illegitimate (Mill & Quinn 2001). Prumnopitys elegans (Phil) is a synonym for Prumnopitys andina.The fruit (an Aril) are tasty, 1.5 cm (0.6 in) long, blue-purple color and are eaten by Native American people in Chile, and a marmalade is produced with them. The tree is also occasionally grown as an ornamental tree and a hedge in oceanic climate areas in northwest Europe and the Pacific Northwest of North America. In these areas, it is also sometimes known as \"Plum-yew\" or \"Plum-fruited Yew\", though these names are more commonly applied to plants in the genus Cephalotaxus (Cephalotaxaceae).Wood: yellowish color and has a good quality, used in furniture and construction.Evidence suggests that very little regeneration is occurring to replace current ageing trees in populations.

It is today almost only found in small amounts in German-speaking parts of Switzerland, where R\u00E4uschling can produce fruity, crisp white wines with good acidity. R\u00E4uschling has previously been much more common in Switzerland, Germany and Alsace. Before the widespread planting of M\u00FCller-Thurgau, R\u00E4uschling and Elbling were the most common grape varieties in Switzerland. German plantations were found in Franconia, Palatinate and W\u00FCrttemberg, as well as in Baden in medieval times. It is also thought to have been the grape variety of the early wines traded from Tramin, with Gro\u00DFer Traminer being one of its synonyms.The name of the variety is supposed to derive from the robust leaf canopy of R\u00E4uschling vines which make noise - \"rauschen\" in German - in strong wind. However, the name Reuschling first appeared in the vineyard ordnance (Weingartordnung) issued in 1614 by Count Philipp Ernst zu Hohenlohe-Neuenstein. In the herbals written by Hieronymus Bock in the 16th century, it is referred to as Drutsch or Drutscht.The name Gro\u00DFer R\u00E4uschling has been used to differentiate it from the variety Knipperl\u00E9, which was previously common in Alsace and which is also called Kleiner R\u00E4uschling.

It was created in 1964 by Professor V. Kraus in then-Czechoslovakia by crossing the varieties Zarya Severa (a hybrid which has Vitis amurensis in its pedigree) and St. Laurent. He offered it to Dr. Helmut Becker (1927-1990) of the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute who conducted further work on it, which explains why the grape is known under a Geisenheim designation. The variety has been protected since 1997.This very early maturing variety possesses high resistance against winter frost and downy mildew from its Asiatic Vitis amurensis parent. However annual treatments against powdery mildew may still be necessary in the vineyards. Rondo produces a ruby-red wine which is also used for blending. Rondo is cultivated in many locations in northern Europe where dark-skinned Vitis vinifera varieties are difficult to ripen properly, as it tends to yield good colour and aroma even in those locations. Rondo is cultivated in Rheinhessen and in many locations in northern Europe including Denmark, England, Ireland, the Netherlands and Sweden.In 2011 the British winery Denbies picked up a gold prize in the International Wine Challenge for their 2010 vintage Chalk Ridge Rose, a wine made entirely from Rondo grapes."@en .

Its typical size is small; in optimal conditions, the oldest mature examples reach a radius of some 25 cm, and approximately 20 cm height. It blooms from April through early June; during these weeks, its normally dull appearance changes dramatically due to its characteristic flower.Thymus moroderi is a xerophyte plant which thrives in areas with a total annual precipitation of 300mm and less, as recorded in the southern part of the Alicante province and contiguous areas in Murcia. It also shows a preference for otherwise extremely poor soils, especially those showing traces of gypsum.Despite Thymus moroderi not being listed in any endangered species collection, arguably it is not a common species because of its patchy distribution, it is present in areas that are rather densely populated and the subsequent picking of its flowers (which, despite recommendations to only trim the plant, some may still carry out by uprooting it completely)."@en .

dbpedia:Abouriou	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Abouriou (French spelling of Occitan aboriu, early) is a red French wine grape variety grown primarily in Southwest France and, in small quantities, California. It is a blending grape that, along with Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Fer, Cabernet Franc, and Merlot, is used to make the Appellation d'origine contr\u00F4l\u00E9e (AOC) wine of C\u00F4tes du Marmandais. Abouriou can also be made into a varietal, as it is used in some vin de pays wines. The grape is known for its low acidity and high tannin content.Though Abouriou shares several synonyms (alternative names other than the full botanical name) with the Beaujolais grape Gamay, their morphology differs and DNA evidence has shown the two varieties to be distinct. In California, the grape is sometimes called Early Burgundy, another allusion to Gamay. With a tendency to bud and ripen early, the vine produces high yields and vigorous growth with a relatively high resistance to most grape diseases."@en .

dbpedia:Helonias	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Swamp Pink (Helonias bullata) is a rare perennial rhizomatous herb native to the United States. The root system is extensive in comparison to the apparent size of the plant on the surface. Blooming in March to May, its fragrant flowers are pink and occur in a cluster at the end a vertical spike which may reach up to 3' in height. It has evergreen, lance-shaped, and parallel-veined leaves ranging from dark green to light yellow green in color that form a basal rosette. Swamp Pink occurs in wetland habitats and it requires habitat which is saturated, but not flooded, with water. Ideally the plant prefers an environment where the water table sits at about the level of the top of its root system, but not covering the basal rosette. Typical areas include swampy forested wetlands which border small streams; meadows, and spring seepage areas. It is often found near conifer trees.Swamp Pink is a federally threatened species that was historically distributed from Staten Island, New York to the southern Appalachians. Swamp pink is the only species in its genus. Many extant populations suffer low genetic diversity. Currently, New Jersey supports the largest and most numerous populations, but there are populations in six other states: Delaware; Maryland; Virginia; West Virginia;North Carolina; South Carolina, and Georgia. There is also some unverified indication that a population of Swamp Pink has survived on Staten Island. Populations of Swamp Pink are on occasion subject to poaching by plant enthusiasts and others who prize the early bright pink blooms. Unfortunately, the poached plants likely do not survive their move owing to the high sensitivity to being removed from the water saturated environment, underestimation of the size of the root mass, and failure to replicate the necessary environment sufficiently.United States Fish and Wildlife Service has instituted a volunteer monitoring project, \u201CAdopt-a-Swamp-Pink Population\u201D. The program has been further expanded by a joint volunteer effort with Citizens United to Protect the Maurice River and Its Tributaries, Inc..

The prickly, swollen stems develop natural hollows which are invaded by the Golden Ant (Iridomyrmex cordatus) in a symbiotic arrangement. The ants patrol the plant, removing leaf-eaters, while their excreta is absorbed by the plant for nutrition.The flowers are white and tubular, to 10 mm, and the fruit is white/translucent containing a single seed. These seeds are transported to other trees by the Mistletoebird (Dicaeum hirundinaceum).The Apollo Jewel Butterfly (Hypochrysops apollo apollo) lays its eggs on the plant, and because they smell like ant's eggs, the ants carry the eggs inside the plant, where they develop to the butterfly stage. Hypochrysops is a genus of \"Blues\", butterflies in the family Lycaenidae, which is notorious for its myrmecophily. Accordingly it is likely that the larvae that hatch from the eggs feed either on food begged from the ants, or on ant larvae, or possibly both.

dbpedia:Spartina_patens	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Spartina patens (saltmeadow cordgrass), also known as salt marsh hay, is a species of cordgrass native to the Atlantic coast of the Americas, from Newfoundland south along the eastern United States to the Caribbean and northeast Mexico. It can be found in marshlands in other areas of the world as an introduced species and often a harmful noxious weed or invasive species.It is a hay-like grass found in the upper areas of brackish coastal salt marshes. It is a slender and wiry plant that grows in thick mats 30-60 cm high, green in spring and summer, and turns light brown in late fall and winter. The stems are wispy and hollow, and the leaves roll inward and appear round. Because its stems are weak, the wind and water action can bend the grass, creating the appearance of a field of tufts and cowlicks. Like its relative smooth cordgrass S. alterniflora, saltmeadow cordgrass produces flowers and seeds on only one side of the stalk. Flowers are a deep purple from June to October and turn brown in the winter months.Saltmeadow cordgrass is found in high marsh zones where it is covered at times by high tides. Specialized cells are able to exclude salt from entering the roots, preventing the loss of fresh water. This grass is, however, less tolerant of saltwater than some other marsh grasses. A healthy salt marsh depends on the presence of plants such as salt hay grass and smooth cordgrass. These grasses provide rich habitat for crustaceans, mollusks, and birds, and serve as a major source of organic nutrients for the entire estuary. Mats of salt hay grass are inhabited by many small animals and are an important food source for ducks and Seaside Sparrows.Saltmeadow cordgrass marshes serve as pollution filters and as buffers against flooding and shoreline erosion. During the colonial era, towns scattered from Narragansett Bay to the Gulf of Maine were often settled based on their proximity to salt marshes due to the importance of saltmeadow cordgrass for fodder. It was harvested for bedding and fodder for farm animals and for garden mulch. Before hay was baled and stored under cover, it was used to top the hay stacks in the fields.Many of the salt marshes in Rhode Island have been severely affected by filling, development, and road construction. These alterations restrict tidal flow, often having a severe ecological impact on the marsh. Because saltmeadow cordgrass requires a salty, wet habitat, restricted tidal flow often dries out the marsh and encourages the growth of invasive freshwater plants. Saltmeadow and smooth cordgrasses are often out-competed for space by common reed in areas where human activity has disturbed or altered the marsh. Common reed is not as productive or beneficial to a salt marsh as cordgrass.While this Spartina is a key member of the salt marsh flora in its native habitat, it is known as a harmful invasive species in other parts of the world. It is a notorious pest in the San Francisco Bay Area, where it out-competes native plants such as the soft bird's beak Cordylanthus mollis ssp. mollis and alters the habitat of rare animals such as the Clapper Rail. This cordgrass was introduced to the estuaries of Oregon with shipments of oysters and has been seen dominating and crowding out native vegetation there. It has appeared in marshes on the Iberian Peninsula, where it threatens native plant biodiversity."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clymenia_(plant)>	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Clymenia is a small genus of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae. The rare Clymenia polyandra, occasionally referred to by the archaic Citrus polyandra, is the lone known member of the genus.Cultivated locally for its sweet fruits on a handful of southwestern Pacific islands, clymenia was originally considered an obscure citrus hybrid. Botanist Ty\u00F4zabur\u00F4 Tanaka noted that clymenia would hybridize with a few other citrus plants (notably kumquats), but otherwise was generally different from other citrus in many aspects of its appearance.In the 1960s, botanist Walter Swingle proposed that clymenia might belong to a genus of its own.Native to a handful of locations on Papua New Guinea and nearby islets, clymenia is far more tropical than true citrus, and even in subtropical parts of the United States, it can only be grown in a greenhouse. Specimens planted out in Riverside, California thrived in greenhouses, but perished when planted out in the arid climate. Swingle assumed that clymenia and citrus evolved from a single common ancestor. Clymenia forms a shrub or small tree, free of spines. Leaves feature a short, narrow petiole, which sets them apart from most other citrus, especially the papedas native to the same general area.Clymenia fruits are a small hesperidium, very similar to a citrus fruit. Sweet and lemony in flavor, the tangerine-sized fruits are highly segmented, with yellow pulp, and a leathery rind, similar to a true citrus fruit. They contain a large number of polyembryonic seeds.

Widespread in the southwestern part of North America, it is the only member of the monotypic genus Salazaria.This plant takes the form of a rounded shrub, typically 50-100 cm high, sometimes larger. The stems form a spreading rigid pattern, with the tips often becoming spine-like. The leaves are small, 3-15 mm long and 2-8 mm wide, ovate to elliptic, entire, and with a very short or nonexistent petiole. The 2-lipped flowers develop in pairs facing away from each other; the upper lip is white to light violet and hairy, while the lower lip is 3-lobed and intense dark violet. The calyx starts out as simply a base to the flower, reddish-purple in shade, and then as the flower ages, it expands into its distinctive bag shape, 1-2 cm across, the dried flower eventually falling out of the hole in the end.Flowering is generally April through June, but the bags are durable and may last on the plant into winter, becoming dry and papery.These bushes occupy a variety of habitats in their range, including washes, gravelly or sandy slopes, shrubland, and woodland, often growing intermixed with other shrubs. The range extends from the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada and the deserts of California, east to Texas and south into Mexico. They are relatively common; although both the foliage and flowers are sparse, the distinctive pattern of bags makes them easy to spot from a distance.The genus is named after astronomer Jos\u00E9 Salazar y Larregui, Mexican commissioner for the United States and Mexican Boundary Survey of 1848-55."@en .

As the cactus ages, more ribs may be added and it becomes more cylindrical in shape, growing up to about 70\u2013100 cm tall and 10\u201320 cm in diameter. In the wild, globose to cylindrical stem is covered with a whitish flocking of trichomes. Some horticultural varieties lack the flocking.In the wild, the cacti flower in early spring, so that their seeds can grow with summer rains. In cultivation this differs, and the plants may flower in summer. Plants produce one or more flowers 4\u20136 cm diameter near the apex; the numerous tepals are creamy yellow, sometimes with an orange or red base. Pollinated flowers develop into a hairy reddish fruit about 2-2.5 cm in diameter. Plants may take up to six years to flower. A. myriostigma is commonly grown as an ornamental plant in cactus collections.This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit."@en .

dbpedia:Echinochloa	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Echinochloa is a grass genus, some of whose members are millets grown as cereal or fodder crops. The most notable of these are Japanese millet (E. esculenta) in East Asia, Indian barnyard millet (E. frumentacea) in South Asia, and burgu millet (E. stagnina) in West Africa. Collectively, the members of this genus are called barnyard grasses (though this may also refer to E. crus-galli specifically), barnyard millets or billion-dollar grasses.When not grown on purpose, these grasses may become a nuisance to farmers. In particular, common barnyard grass (E. crus-galli) is notorious as a weed. It is not easily suppressed with living mulches such as velvet bean (Mucuna pruriens var. utilis). Early barnyard grass (E. oryzoides) is a well-known example of Vavilovian mimicry: the plants have evolved to resemble rice (Oryza), enabling them to escape weeding more easily.Among the plant pathogens that affect this genus are the sac fungus Cochliobolus sativus, which has been noted on common barnyard grass, and rice hoja blanca virus. Both affect many other grass species, in particular most important cereals, and Echinochloa weeds may serve as a reservoir. The fungi Drechslera monoceras and Exserohilum monoceras have been evaluated with some success as potential biocontrol agents of common barnyard grass in rice fields. More research is necessary, however, because they may not be host-specific enough to be of practical use."@en .

H. paradoxus is a hybrid of H. annuus, the common sunflower, and Helianthus petiolaris, the prairie sunflower. The hybridization took place 75,000-208,000 years ago. The hybrid is more tolerant of salt than either parent species. H. paradoxus is found in areas with salinity levels range from 10 to 40 parts per thousand. Due to its ability to withstand such high levels of salt, H. paradoxus is considered to be a halophyte. Pecos sunflower is an annual, herbaceous plant. It grows 1\u20133 meters (m) (3.3 - 9.9 feet (ft)) tall and is branched at the top. The leaves are opposite on the lower part of the stemand alternate at the top, lance-shaped with three prominent veins, and up to 17.5 centimeters(cm) (6.9 inches (in)) long by 8.5 cm (3.3 in) wide. The stem and leaf surfaces have a few short,stiff hairs. Flower heads are 5\u20137 cm (2.0-2.8 in) in diameter with bright yellow rays around adark purplish brown center (the disc flowers). Flowers are produced in September and October, much later than many other sunflowers.This species was added to the Endangered Species Act on October 20, 1999.

It was formerly classified in the family Monotropaceae, however, it has now been included within the Ericaceae. It is generally scarce or rare in occurrence.Unlike most plants, it is white and does not contain chlorophyll. Instead of generating energy from sunlight, it is parasitic, more specifically a myco-heterotroph. Its hosts are certain fungi that are mycorrhizal with trees, meaning it ultimately gets its energy from photosynthetic trees. Since it is not dependent on sunlight to grow, it can grow in very dark environments as in the understory of dense forest. It is often associated with beech trees. The complex relationship that allows this plant to grow also makes propagation difficult.The plant is sometimes completely white but commonly has black flecks anda pale pink coloration. Rare variants may havea deep red color.The stems reach heights of 10\u201330 cm, clothed with small scale-leaves 5\u201310 mm long.

dbpedia:Pennisetum_purpureum	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Pennisetum purpureum also known as Napier grass, elephant grass or Ugandan grass, is a species of perennial tropical grass native to the African grasslands. It has low water and nutrient requirements, and therefore can make use of otherwise uncultivated lands. Historically, this wild species has been used primarily for grazing; recently, however, it has been incorporated into a pest management strategy. This technique involves the desired crop being planted alongside a \u2018push\u2019 plan, which repels pests, in combination with a \u2018pull\u2019 crop around the perimeter of the plot, which draw insects out of the plot. Napier grass has shown potential at attracting stemborer moths (a main cause of yield loss in Africa) away from maize and hence is the \u201Cpull\u201D crop. This strategy is much more sustainable, serves more purposes and is more affordable for farmers than insecticide use.

dbpedia:Rhizanthella_gardneri	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Rhizanthella gardneri, also known as Western Underground Orchid, is a plant in the orchid family, discovered in the spring of 1928 in the wheatbelt of Western Australia.Jack Trott had bent to investigate an odd crack that had appeared in his garden's soil, and had noticed a sweet smell that arose from the ground. Scraping away the soil, he soon uncovered a tiny white flower, about half an inch across, growing underground. What he had found was an entirely new type of orchid. The discovery generated such excitement that a wax model was toured around the British Isles.The white leafless plant is made up of a fleshy underground storage stem (or tuber), which produces flower head consisting of around 150 tightly packed, tiny flowers. Unlike any other orchid in Australia, the Western Australian underground orchid remains completely underground for its whole life. Not being able to obtain the sun's energy, it instead feeds on the broom honeymyrtle, a shrub. It is linked to it by a mycorrhizal fungus named Thanatephorus gardneri.This particular orchid is a myco-heterotroph as it relies completely on the broom honeymyrtle and fungus for its nutrients and carbon dioxide. Having received this from the fungus the plant is then able to convert the water, nutrients and carbon dioxide into the energy needed for growth and maintenance.The plant blooms in May and June and measures 2.5\u20133 cm. The flower head contains 8 to 90 small dark maroon flowers.Rhizanthella gardneri reproduces vegetatively by which it can produce three daughter plants. They also undergo sexual reproduction, and underground insects such as termites and gnats are known to pollinate the flowers, attracted by the fragrance. The pollinated flower will then take six months to mature. In all studied flowers these were not dispersed and eventually decayed, thus releasing their seeds. It may be, however, that native marsupials were important dispersal agents, but substantial findings are hard to come by as only 19 mature specimens of the orchid are known to currently exist in the wild and only 300 specimens have been collected to date."@en .
dbpedia:Silvaner	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Sylvaner or Silvaner is a variety of white wine grape grown primarily in Alsace and Germany, where its official name is Gr\u00FCner Silvaner. In Germany it is best known as a component of Liebfraumilch and production boomed in the 1970s to the detriment of quality, but it has long enjoyed a better reputation in Franconia than in other German wine regions. While the Alsatian versions have primarily been considered simpler wines, it was recently (2006) included among the varieties that can be used to produce Alsace Grand Cru wine together with the four 'noble grapes' of Alsace, although only in one vineyard, Zotzenberg.This dichotomy is explained by the vigour of the Sylvaner vine and the grape's neutral flavour, which can lead to blandness unless yields are controlled. On the other hand it gives a blank canvas for the expression of terroir, and on good sites with skilled winemaking, Sylvaner can produce elegant wines. It has high acidity but naturally reaches high must weights, so is often blended with other varieties such as Riesling or Elbling, and is sometimes made into a dessert wine."@en .

Common names for the plant include Fluted gourd, Fluted pumpkin, and Ugu. Telfairia occidentalis is a member of the curcurbitaceae family and is indigenous to southern Nigera. The fluted gourd grows in many nations of West Africa but is mainly cultivated in Nigeria, used primarily in soups and herbal medicines. Although the fruit is inedible, the seeds produced by the gourd are high protein and fat, and can therefore contribute to a well-balanced diet. The plant is a drought-tolerant, dioecious perennial that is usually grown trellised.Telfaira occidentalis is traditionally used by an estimated 30 to 35 million people Indigenous people in Nigeria, including the Efik, Ibibio, and Urhobo; However, it was predominantly used by the Igbo tribe, who continue to cultivate the gourd for food sources and traditional medicines. A recurring subject in the Igbo\u2019s folklore, the fluted gourd is noted to have healing properties and was used as a blood tonic, to be administered to the weak or ill.

dbpedia:Vernonia_galamensis	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Vernonia galamensis is a plant in the sunflower family, known for its use as an oilseed. This species, often called ironweed, is the largest source of vernonia oil, which is rich in a useful epoxy fatty acid called vernolic acid and is used to make plastics, rubbery coatings, and drying agents. Use of this oil as a replacement for traditional plasticizers and binders in the production of paints and PVC shows promise as a method of reducing smog pollution.One of over 1,000 species in genus Vernonia, V. galamensis is native to East Africa. It is grown in the region as an industrial oilseed. Its seed production is poor when it is grown outside of the equatorial region, so cultivation in other places is not always economically worthwhile; however, further studies in the breeding of this species to generate more productive varieties may show promise. It requires loose, porous soil and long periods of dry conditions.It is grown in many parts of Ethiopia, especially around the city of Harar, with an average seed yield of 2 to 2.5 t/ha. It is reported that the Ethiopian strains of Vernonia have the highest oil content, up to 41.9% with up to 80% vernolic acid, and is used in paint formulations, coatings plasticizers, and as a reagent for many industrial chemicals.Vernonia galamensis is a daisylike annual which is quite variable in appearance between individual plants. It produces a flower which may be blue or purple, with long petals surrounding a center made up of shorter petals called florets. The center is filled with seeds, some of which may have a hairy tuft called a pappus. Depending on environmental conditions the plant may be squat and shrubby or extremely tall. It may send out few stems, each with one flower, or many stems with bunches of flowers.When not found in cultivation, the plant may be found growing wild, often as a weed which invades disturbed areas and rangeland. A number of insects feed on the plant. Species of the moth genus Indent are sometimes known as vernonia worms due to their preference for Vernonia plants as food.

The illustration of the plant which accompanied its first description was based on a drawing by Lady Acland . The genus was named in honour of Sir William Cattley, a prominent British horticulturist.C. aclandiae is found growing on tree limbs and trunks in the Brazilian state of Bahia. It has a very small natural range and is found growing in the wind southwest of Salvador on elevated plateaus that border the drainage of the Paraguaca River. Its native habitat is seasonally dry forests between 100 and 400 meters in elevation near permanent bodies of water.C. aclandiae is compact and only grows 3-5 in. (7-12 cm) tall. The upright, short, cylindrical pseudobulbs have two fleshy leaves at the apex. Sometimes, purple blotches are found on the leaves when the plants are exposed to intense sunlight. Each growth produces between one and three 2.5 inches to 4 inches (6 to 10 cm) and the flowers are large for the size of the plant. Flowers are substantial, waxy, and long-lived. Flower color is white or near-white with purple blotches and spots. The lip has a dark purple blotch and the anther cap is yellow. Flowers bloom in the spring and summer on new growths.C. aclandiae has been widely used by orchid breeders to produce compact hybrids. When crossed with other bifoliate cattleyas, the spotted pattern is present in the offspring. Hybrids of this species generally produce plants that flower two or more times per year.Several color varieties of C. aclandiae are known. A coerulea form is available in the orchid trade. The 'Rubra' varieties exhibit intensely deep rose lips with very large dark spots on petals and sepals, these spots often coalescing to appear almost solid deep chocolate brown. The 'alba' varieties have petals and sepals of clear lime green with snow white lips. 'Albescen' varieties have sepals and petals of light green with very pastel spots and white lips with little or no color. The more common forms of c. aclandiae have sepal and petal background colors that range from clear green with dark spots to quite yellow with dark spots. The spotting pattern may be bold, almost solid in some clones to more 'peppered', with lips ranging from light rose to deep rose-purple.In cultivation, C. aclandiae prefers intermediate to warm orchid growing temperatures. Ample water is needed during periods of active growth; less water during the winter. High humidity is appreciated as long as adequate air circulation is present. Grow on cork bark or tree fern mounts or in pots with a coarse, free-draining growing media (fir bark or equivalent)."@en .

Through plant invasion this species has become naturalized in many other parts of the world. Some of these naturalized regions include South Africa, North Western Europe, Australia and North America. Given the wide range of climate and ecological conditions of these regions, B. elongata has been able to disrupt the ecosystems of their native plant habitats and has been label as an invasive species in many of its naturalized zones. In North America, this species is often found as a roadside weed in the southwestern states, particularly in the state of Nevada. Studies allude that the Cruciferae might have migrated through the Bering land bridge from what is now Central Asia. Commonly known as the long-stalked rape or as langtraubiger Kohl in German, this species is a close cousin to Brassica napus (rapeseed) and a secondary genetic relative to B. oleracea (kale). As a close genetic species of the rapeseed, the long-stalked rape has one of the highest counts of accumulated polyunsaturated linoleic and linolenic acid. Both compounds are heavily used to manufacture vegetable oils. Brassica elongata has the propagative potential of turning into a horticultural product from what is currently a noxious weed."@en .

dbpedia:Grevillea_cyranostigma	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Grevillea cyranostigma, commonly known as the Carnarvon grevillea or Green grevillea, is a shrub species that is endemic to Queensland in Australia. It was first formally described by Don McGillivray in 1975. He named it cyranostigma after Edmond Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac, as its long stigma was reminiscent of the character's protruding nose. The type specimen was collected between 1890 and 1895 by Harriette Biddulph of Mount Playfair Station, who was known for her collection of plants from the Carnarvon Range. The species appears to be related to Grevillea sericea and G. victoriae, and is distinguished by glossier leaves than the former and a less hairy perianth than both.Grevillea cyranostigma grows as a many-branched spreading shrub reaching 0.5 to 2 m (20 in to 7 ft) high. It has simple glossy leaves that are roughly oblong and are 2\u20135.5 cm (0.8\u20132.2 in) long and 0.5\u20131.1 cm (0.2\u20130.4 in) wide. The pale green flowers appear in winter and spring from June to October. Each is an inflorescence composed of several individual flowers, with pistils that are 16 to 17.5 mm long. The flowers are followed by the development of oval follicles 14\u201315 mm in length.The species is restricted to the Carnarvon Range in Central Queensland, where it is found on rocky slopes on sandstone soils in dry sclerophyll forest. It is classified as 3RC, as it is protected in Carnarvon National Park.Grevillea cyranostigma has been grown in gardens in Brisbane and Melbourne and appears to adapt readily to cultivation, although does not tolerate extended dry periods. It has been mainly cultivated by collectors and enthusiasts of grevilleas."@en .

He named it in honour of surveyor and botanist Richard Hind Cambage.Eucalyptus cambageana reaches heights of 15 to 25 m with a spreading crown of 5\u201315 m, and a single straight trunk. The lower trunk has rough dark grey tessellated bark while the branches have smooth pale bark. The dull grey-green adult leaves are lanceolate, measuring 10\u201318 cm long by 2\u20133 cm wide, and are arranged alternately along the stems. In contrast, juvenile leaves are 8\u201315 cm long by 2.5\u20133.5 cm wide, and almost oppositely arranged.Appearing over December and January, the white flowers occur in groups of 3 to 7 umbellate flowerheads. Each measures 0.8 cm in diameter.The range is across central Queensland. It grows in scrubland or open woodland with brigalow (Acacia harpophylla), belah (Casuarina cristata), and wilga (Geijera parviflora). These open woodland communities where it is co-dominant with brigalow are found on clay, alluvial, or sedimentary soils.In central Queensland, the presence of Eucalyptus cambageana is an indicator of sodic soil, which has implications for agriculture in the region.The heavy reddish-brown timber is used for fence posts in the local area.

It is native to the western United States, where it is known from about ten locations in and around the Great Basin within the states of Idaho, Oregon, and California. Specimens of the plant had been catalogued as Mimulus breviflorus, but on further examination it was evident that they were a separate, unclassified species; this was described to science in 1995. It is thought that the plant may have evolved via hybridization between M. breviflorus and M. latidens, or that M. evanescens evolved from M. latidens and then into M. breviflorus.M. evanescens is a succulent annual herb coated with tiny glandular hairs and having a somewhat slimy texture. The thin stems grow mostly erect to a maximum height near 25 centimeters. The leaves are lance-shaped to oval and up to 4 centimeters long by 3 wide. The flowers are small and barely open, their tubular bases enclosed in a ribbed calyx of sepals which becomes papery and inflated as the fruits mature. The flower is less than a centimeter long and is mostly yellow in color, sometimes with brownish dots in the throat.M. evanescens has been observed in rocky sagebrush habitat, especially in areas still moist from early spring soaking. Most of the areas where the plant grows are on rangeland used for grazing livestock. Threats to the plant include land degradation from cattle grazing, encroachment by invasive plant species, and changes in the hydrology of the plant's vernally wet habitat."@en .

dbpedia:Coleochaete	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Coleochaete is a genus of parenchymatous charophyte green algae in the order Coleochaetales. They are haploid, reproduce asexually, they can be characterised by true multicellular organisation (with plasmodesmata), creating planar sprawling discs on solid surfaces in freshwater streams worldwide, usually as epiphytes on aquatic plants or growing on the surface of stones. They are seen as one of two most probable sister groups to land plant species. (The second candidates being the Characeae, the issue - as of 2009 - is still not solved). As they show some of the earliest and simplest features of multicellular plant growth, that makes them ideal model organisms in the field of synthetic biology.[citation needed] They are easy to culture and techniques that have been used to study Arabidopsis thaliana are now being applied to the Coleochaete.Coleochaete also has a sterile jacket of cells that surround the gametangia, and zygotes that are protected by a layer of sterile cells after fertilization. However, unlike plants, the Charophyceae have zygotic meiosis and therefore Coleochaete could not have been the literal ancestor of plants, but was possibly a member of a sister group."@en .

dbpedia:Solanum_repandum	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Solanum repandum is a species of evergreen shrub native to various island groups across the southern Pacific Ocean and occasionally grown for its edible fruit. Only partially domesticated and very rare in cultivation outside of its native range, it is also known as kokoua or huou. Solanum repandum will apparently hybridize with a number of close relatives, including the South American naranjilla, pseudolulo, and Solanum candidum, along with the Solanum lasiocarpum, from India. Solanum repandum is, in fact, so similar in growth habit and in its fruit that it has been possibly considered a subspecies of either Solanum quitoense (naranjilla) or Solanum lasiocarpum. The three species are native to different geographical areas, and tolerate slightly different climatic conditions, but their overall habit of growth is nearly identical, as is the use for the fruit in local cuisines. Each of them features a unique ring of emerald green juice surrounding the seeds in fruit that otherwise ripen to yellow or orange. The immature fruit is covered is bristles, which detach easily upon full ripening. Like many of its relatives, S. repandum is a close relative of other nightshades cultivated for their edible fruit, including the tomato (S. lycopersicum), the naranjilla (S. quitoense) and the eggplant (S. melongena). It will readily hybridize with Solanum candidum, Solanum quitoense (naranjilla), Solanum lasiocarpum (Indian nightshade), and Solanum sessiliflorum (cocona), though in some cases those hybrids are sterile.Scientifically, S. repandum is of additional scientific interest, as is S. candidum, as they appear to be the closest relatives and a possible link species between the Asian and South American members of the same botanical clade."@en .

dbpedia:Carex_lutea	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Carex lutea is a rare species of sedge known by the common names golden sedge and sulphur sedge. It is endemic to North Carolina, where it is known only from Pender and Onslow Counties in the Cape Fear River watershed. There are nine populations. The plant was discovered in 1991 and described to science as a new species in 1994, and it has not been thoroughly studied nor completely surveyed yet. Its rarity was obvious by 2002, however, when it was federally listed as an endangered species.This sedge was discovered in a very rare type of habitat made up of wet savannah on coquina limestone substrate. It occurs on the edge of a swampy section of North Carolina's coastal plain, and the sandy, acidic soil is either wet or submerged. This habitat experiences periodic wildfire every few years which clears brush, creating an open canopy. This fire regime is apparently vital to the rare Carex and other plants that cannot grow if the woody brush grows up and outcompetes them. Fire suppression efforts in the area threaten the plant and its ecosystem; some of the populations occur on private land that is not allowed to burn. It generally does not grow in an area without periodic fires unless it is mowed to clear the brush or it is too wet for large woody vegetation to grow. Other threats include logging and herbicide use. Destruction of the habitat or alterations in its hydrology could damage populations.Despite its small numbers and habitat specificity, the sedge has a relatively high genetic diversity compared to similar, more widespread species.This plant is a perennial sedge forming clumps of narrow stems which may exceed 1 meter (3 ft 3 in) in height. The thin leaves are up to 28 centimeters (11 in) long. The staminate (male) inflorescence is a spike of flowers up to 4 cm (1.6 in) long, the spikelets clad in reddish brown or light brown scales. The pistillate (female) inflorescence is under 3 cm (1.2 in) long and has yellow-green flowers that yield beaked fruits."@en .

A possible second species is known from South Africa."@en .
dbpedia:Nuphar_saggitifolia	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Nuphar saggitifolia, common name Arrow-leaved water-lily or Cape Fear spatterdock, is a plant species known only from North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. It is aquatic, found in lakes, ponds, and slow-moving rivers in the coastal plains of those states.. It is also sold in pet shops as greenery to grow in aquaria and water-gardens.Nuphar saggitifolia is a perennial herb with rhizomes buried in the mud below the water. Leaf blades either float on the surface of the water or are submerged beneath it. Petioles are terete (round in cross-section). Leaves are 3-lobed and sagittate (arrow-shaped or V-shaped), the tips of the lobes sometimes rounded. Flowers are green and yellow, 2-3 cm (0.8-1.2 inches) in diameter, usually held above the surface of the water."@en .

dbpedia:Phacelia_californica	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Phacelia californica is a species of phacelia known by the common names California phacelia and California scorpionweed. It is native to coastal northern California and Oregon, where it grows in chaparral, woodland, and coastal bluffs and grassland. It is a perennial herb growing decumbent or erect, its branching stems reaching up to 90 centimeters long. It is roughly hairy in texture. The leaves are up to 20 centimeters long, the lower ones divided into several leaflets. The dense, hairy inflorescence is a one-sided curving or coiling cyme of many bell-shaped flowers. Each white or pale blue to lavender flower is under a centimeter wide.This native wildflower is a food source for the Mission blue butterfly, an endangered species endemic to San Francisco."@en .
dbpedia:Pinus_peregrinus	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Pinus peregrinus is an extinct species of pine in the Pinaceae family known from Clarkforkian age Paleocene fossils found in western North Dakota, USA.The species was described from three wing seed specimens found at localities 14051a and 14083 in the Bear Den member of the Golden Valley Formation with associated needles from the Heart River Bluffs area, site 14051a, provisionally assigned to the species also. The Bear Den member outcrops at a number of sites in western North Dakota, and is designated the type locality.The holotype specimen, number PU 20091, is preserved in the Princeton University collections, and paratype specimens are in the National Museum of Natural History collections of the Smithsonian Institution. The specimens were studied by paleobotanist Leo J. Hickey of the Yale University Geology Department. Dr Hickey published the 1977 type description for P. peregrinus in the Geological Society of America memoir 150, Stratigraphy and Paleobotany of the Golden Valley Formation (Early Tertiary) of Western North Dakota. Dr Hickey chose the specific name peregrinus, which is Latin meaning \"stranger\" or \"newcomer\" noting the species to be the first megafossil record for the pine family to be described from Rocky Mountains and Great Plains Paleocene rocks.The winged seeds of Pinus peregrinus are between 20 and 23 millimetres (0.79 and 0.91 in) long and have a nutlet located in the base of the wing to one side of the wing axis. The small, 4 to 5 millimetres (0.16 to 0.20 in) long nutlet is three sided and generally deltoid to ovoid in shape. The wing possesses a thickened inside margin that is straight, while the thin outside margin arches from nutlet to distal tip of the wing. The wing membrane is slightly striated parallel to the wing margins and curving towards the outside margin near the tip. This combination of characters is specific to the genus Pinus, and the seeds are most similar to the modern Pinus resinosa and Pinus tropicalis. The needles provisionally included in P. peregrinus can reach up to 10 centimetres (3.9 in) long with a distinct midrib."@en .

dbpedia:Prionosciadium_saraviki	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Prionosciadium saraviki, common name saraviki, is a plant species in the genus Prionosciadium, in the carrot family, Apiaceae. It is known only from a mountainous region of the Sierra Madre Occidental in the Mexican State of Chihuahua. Type locale is the village of Nabogame, approximately 18 km northwest of Yepachic, Chihuahua, 10 km east of the border with Sonora. The plant grows there mostly along creekbanks and near springs.Prionosciadium saraviki is a biennial producing a flowering stalk up to 2 m (7 feet) tall. It bears a compound umbel with hundreds of small yellow flowers. The taproot is up to 3 cm in diameter, white with a papery, copper-colored skin.A few sources (e.g. The Plant List) have misspelled the epithet as \"saravikii.\" This is an error because the epithet is the native name for the species, not honoring a person."@en .
dbpedia:Prunus_nipponica	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Prunus nipponica, also called Japanese Alpine Cherry (\u9AD8\u5DBA\u685C, Takanezakura), is a shrub which originates from the islands of Hokkaido and Honshu, Japan. It grows to a height of about 5 meters (16 ft) and can grow in sandy, loamy, and clay soils.This species is one of the hardiest of cherry trees, well-suited to cold climates. The flowers are a very light pink or even white in color. Flowers bloom in the first half of spring. They have 5 petals and are 3 centimeters (1.2 in) in diameter. The pistils are usually longer than the stamen. The leaves are serrated and the bark is gray. In autumn the leaves turn yellow and orange-red; these are rare autumnal colors for a cherry tree.P. nipponica wood contains significant amounts of these flavonoids: d-catechin, naringenin, sakuranetin, eriodictyol, taxifolin, genistein, and prunetin. Being a member of the genus Prunus, P. nipponica would contain amygdalin and prunasin which form hydrocyanic acid when combined with water. This acid is poisonous but in very small doses it can improve respiration, digestion, and a sense of well-being. The fruit can be used as food and to make green dye.This species was first reported by Japanese botanist Ninzo Matsumura in the Tokyo Botanical Magazine in 1901. It is in the section Pseudocerasus of the cherry subgenus Cerasus of the Prunus genus, which are ornamental plants. Ma et al classified it in a group with Prunus incisa. P. nipponica is on the \"List of Protected Animals and Plants in the Wildlife Protection Zone\" of the wilderness Shirakami-Sanchi World Heritage Site."@en .
