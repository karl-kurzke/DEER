dbpedia:Faith_Soloway	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Faith Soloway (born March 28, 1964) is an American folk-rock musician, comedic performer, and creator of several folk-rock musicals, based in the Boston area. She studied theater at Indiana University and performed improv comedy regularly, along with leaving school to tour with Second City. She spent three years as music director for Second City, which led to the creation of Soloway's first original musical, The Real Life Brady Bunch. The show, which premiered in 1990, was a collaboration with her sister, Jill Soloway, and it toured across the country. Both Soloway sisters moved to Hollywood briefly to produce television shows, but Faith Soloway decided she was not interested in television work and in 1994, moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts to pursue a songwriting career.After performing at open mike nights as a solo musician, Soloway began producing a series of rock operas that were performed at Club Passim. She started with the minimalist The Principal and the Potter, which was followed by Miss Folk America (which featured what became one of Soloway's signature songs, Queer in Revere and Debbie Does Falcon Ridge, both of which parodied the folk scene. In 2000, Soloway produced Miss Folk America at the Somerville Theater, a larger venue. This was followed by Jesus Has Two Mommies (the title refers to the controversial children's book Heather Has Two Mommies), which featured such notable Boston folk musicians as Catie Curtis and Jennifer Kimball.Soloway also works at Charles River Creative Arts Program, in Dover, Massachusetts in the summer, in the theater and music departments. For the camp, she has written the musicals \"Harry\" \"Norbert Beany is Action Man\" and \"Hamletta\" with Tom Evans. Soloway's lone solo album, Training Wheels, features her song Lesbo Song, which is at once a statement of her sexuality and a tweaking of the earnest, humorless stereotype of women's music. Her song Sister's Boyfriend was featured on the Respond compilation, a benefit for domestic violence causes. She continues to perform with her band, the Faith Soloway Crisis.Soloway's ex-partner, writer Harlyn Aizley, wrote a book entitled Buying Dad about the couple's efforts to conceive a child via artificial insemination (their daughter Betsy was born in 2002). Soloway wrote an essay, Betsy Loves Bobbies, that will appear in a forthcoming anthology edited by Aizley, The Other Mother: Tales from the Lesbian Home-front, or, Nonbiological Mothers Tell All. After the couple separated, Soloway started work on a new show, \"Journey to the Self: One Woman\u2019s Self Journey\". Her new partner, Carol Rosenthal, is very active in Hollywood."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ger%C3%B3nimo_Gim%C3%A9nez>	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Ger\u00F3nimo Gim\u00E9nez y Bellido (October 10, 1854, Seville \u2013 February 19, 1923, Madrid) was a Spanish conductor and composer, who dedicated his career to writing zarzuelas, such as La tempranica and La boda de Luis Alonso. He preferred to spell his first name with a \"G\", even though it began officially with a \"J\".Although the details of his early years are not entirely certain, Gim\u00E9nez was probably born in Seville and spent his childhood and adolescence in C\u00E1diz. A child prodigy, he began music lessons with his father and continued his education with Salvador Viniegra. By the age of 12, he was already playing among the first violins of the Teatro Principal orchestra in C\u00E1diz. Five years later, he became the director of an opera and zarzuela company, making his debut in Gibraltar with a production of Giovanni Pacini's Safo.A scholarship permitted Gim\u00E9nez to enrol at the Conservatoire de Paris in June 1874, where he studied violin with Jean-Delphin Alard and composition with Ambroise Thomas. He received the first prize for harmony and counterpoint. After graduation, he traveled to Italy and then returned to Spain, settling in Madrid. In 1885, he was named director of Teatro Apolo de Madrid, and shortly afterwards, of the Teatro de la Zarzuela.Ruperto Chap\u00ED commissioned him to write the openings to his zarzuelas El Milagro de la Virgen and La bruja. As a conductor of the Sociedad de Conciertos de Madrid, Gim\u00E9nez helped cultivate the tastes of audiences in Madrid for symphonic music. According to \"those who have seem him conduct [and] have transmitted to us the memory of his performances of great strength and great enthusiasm [\u2026] he obtained with imperceptible gestures what he wanted from the orchestra.\"A prolific composer, Gim\u00E9nez also collaborated with the leading authors of sainetes (a comic genre found in Spanish theatre), including Ricardo de la Vega, Carlos Arniches, the brothers Seraf\u00EDn and Joaqu\u00EDn \u00C1lvarez Quintero, and Javier de Burgos, to obtain the libretti for his zarzuelas. He co-wrote the music of a number of his works with Amadeo Vives, who hailed him the \"musician of elegance\" because of his sense of rhythm and easy melodies.In 1896, Gim\u00E9nez wrote El mundo comedia es, or El baile de Luis Alonso, based on a text by Javier de Burgos. Following the success of this piece, he set to music another sainete by Burgos with the same characters, which became one of his most famous works: Las bodas de Luis Alonso, or La noche del encierro (1897). This second work, which achieved much greater success than the first, was actually meant to be a prequel, not a sequel.La tempranica was perhaps his most ambitious and successful work. Presented at the Teatro de la Zarzuela on September 19, 1900, it followed a text by Julian Romea. Gim\u00E9nez skillfully managed to combine moments of intense lyricism with scenes of colloquial explosion in a zarzuela which, according to Carlos G\u00F3mez Amat, \"had all the qualities of the genre and none of the faults\". The influence of Gim\u00E9nez is often noticeable in the compositions of subsequent Spanish composers, such as Joaqu\u00EDn Turina and Manuel de Falla (especially the stylistic correspondences between La tempranica and the latter's opera La vida breve). Federico Moreno Torroba adapted the celebrated zarzuela into an opera by setting the spoken parts to music. In 1939, Joaqu\u00EDn Rodrigo also paid his respects with a Homenaje a la tempranica, which contained a solo part for castanets.Beyond dramatic works for the stage, Gim\u00E9nez also wrote three cadenzas to Beethoven's Violin Concerto.Towards the end of his life, Gim\u00E9nez lived in a precarious economic situation, which was made worse by the Madrid Conservatory's refusal to grant him a professorship in chamber music. He died on February 19, 1923, in Madrid."@en .

Later with Berlanga and Alaska formed Alaska y los pegamoides with Ana Curra and Eduardo Benavente. He became one of the cornerstones of The Madrilenian Groove (Movida) with this band, and a big influence for all the punk bands which appeared later. The name of the band was adopted in the line of Siouxsie and the Banshees (which is a recognized influence in his music). With this band he achieved some hits like 'Horror en el hipermercado', 'Bote de Colon', 'Llegando hasta el final' and 'Bailando' (which became an international hit). The songs by Alaska y los Pegamoides appeared in 1982 under the title 'Grandes Exitos'(hispavox).After the dissolution of Alaska y los Pegamoides, Canut, Berlanga and Alaska formed one of the most successful bands of the Spanish eighties, Alaska y Dinarama. Alaska y Dinarama became one of the first glam bands in Spain. Some of the finest songs ever written in the history of modern Spanish music had been composed by Canut and Berlanga. Among them, 'Ni tu ni nadie' and '\u00BFA qui\u00E9n le importa?' became hymns for the LGBT Spanish movement, apart from the massive success of songs like 'Mi novio es un zombie', 'Quiero ser santa' and 'Descongelate'.When Carlos Berlanga left the band, Nacho Canut and Alaska formed a new band, Fangoria in 1989. This band represented a turn from rock to techno-pop, though the rock influence is still felt in certain songs. With this band he has already published nine studio albums, from 'Salto Mortal' (1990) to 'Absolutamente' (2009).

dbpedia:Albertet_de_Sestaro	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Albertet de Sestaro, sometimes called Albertet de Terascon (fl. 1194\u20131221), was a Proven\u00E7al jongleur and troubadour from the Gapen\u00E7ais (Gapens\u00E9s in Occitan). Of his total oeuvre, twenty three poems survive. \"Albertet\" or \"Albertetz\" is the Occitan diminutive of Albert. Unqualified it usually refers to Albertet de Sestaro, but there was an Albertet Cailla. According to his vida he was the son of a noble jongleur named Asar, one of whose pieces may survive. Albertet was reputed for his voice and for the innovative melodies of his short cans\u00F3s, but not for his lyrics. Fellow troubadour Uc de Lescura praised Albertet's votz a ben dir (\"well-spoken-of voice\"). He was a welcomed performer and conversationalist in court society. Much of his life was spent at Orange, where he grew wealthy before moving to Lombardy, where he remained from 1210 to 1221. In Italy he frequented the courts of Savoy, Montferrat, Malaspina, Genoa, and the Este in Ferrara. At the Este court he probably came into contact with Guillem Augier Novella, Aimeric de Pegulhan, and Aimeric de Belenoi. He also travelled west of Provence as far as Montferrand, where he met Dalf\u00ED d'Alvernha, Gaucelm Faidit, and Peirol, and by some accounts he even took refuge in Spain at some point. Eventually he returned to Sisteron in the Forcalquier, where he died.One of Albertet's most famous works is a satire which heaps praise on seven prominent women of his time, notably Beatrice of Savoy, wife of Raymond Berengar IV of Provence. There is also a tens\u00F3 between Albertet and Aimeric de Pegulhan: N'Albertz, chausetz a vostre sen. This tens\u00F3 is evidence that Albertet called himself Albert, though later scribes usually employed the diminutive. Albertet also composed a tenso with Aimeric de Belenoi. He praised Augier and Gaucelm Faidit, and he honoured Peirol by name in one tornada:Asides from this request to Peirol, Albertet elsewhere begged his lady to learn his poems, possibly with an eye to the propagation through further singing and recitation:Despite his reputation as a musician, only two of his surviving works\u2014 the Mos coratges m'es camjatz and A! mi no fai chantar foilla ni flors (both cans\u00F3s)\u2014have complete melodies, though one other (En mon cor ai un' aital encobida) is partially extant. There is another piece, a descort entitled Bel m'es oimais, which does not survive with music in its only manuscript but which might have been the model for the strophic lai Bel m'est li tans of the trouv\u00E8re Colin Muset. Another trouv\u00E8re, Mahieu le Juif, was probably influenced by a piece of Albertet's in composing the text for his song beginning Par grant. Each piece of Albertet's surviving musical work is distinct, though on the whole it is conservative, written within one tenth interval, syllabic with melismas only at the ends of phrases. Mos coratges is conventional but ornate; En mon cor appears to have been through-composed; and A! mi no fai chantar is complex and subtle, written in a simple style, but with unique intervals and phrasing."@en .

One can find traces of maracatu, coco and \"repentes de viola\" (improvising fast-paced Brazilian folk music) in most of his songs. Alceu was able to utilize the electric guitar the electric bass, and lately even a synthesizer was added to his broad scope of musical instruments. Because of that, Alceu was able to recreate Northeastern traditional music, like bai\u00E3o, coco, toada, maracatu, frevo, caboclinhos, embolada and repentes: all sung with a sometimes rock sometimes alternative sounding music background.

After studying at the Naples Conservatory under Beniamino Cesi (and composition under Paolo Serrao), he began teaching piano at his alma mater in 1887, deputizing for Cesi as pianoforte professor, and succeeded him in 1897. As a pianist, Longo often played in chamber ensemble with the Ferni Quartet, and with the Quartetto Napoletano (with Cantani, Parmiciano, Scarano and Viterbini). He founded various musical institutions in Naples, and gained a high reputation as a concert pianist. In 1914 he began editing the review L'Arte Pianistica. He became Director of the Naples Conservatory in 1944, and died in Naples the following year, aged 80.Today, Longo is mainly remembered for compiling an almost comprehensive catalogue of the keyboard works of Domenico Scarlatti. For many years, Scarlatti's keyboard sonatas were conventionally identified by their Longo numbers, but these were later superseded by those found in Ralph Kirkpatrick's catalogue. Longo's Catalogue originated in his landmark full publication of the works of Scarlatti in 11 volumes and implied particular groupings of the sonatas, the chronology of which was later completely revised and differently grouped in Kirkpatrick's 1953 study of the composer. Longo also edited works by Domenico Gallo.His compositions include, among others, two works for piano four-hands, a serenade and a suite; suites for piano with bassoon with oboe, with flute and with clarinet.His son, Achille Longo (1900\u20131954), was also a composer."@en .

dbpedia:Alex_Soria	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Alex Soria (1965\u20132004) was a rock and roll musician from Montreal. and founding member of the power pop/punk rock groups \"The Nils\" (1978\u20132004) and \"Chino\" (1999). Born in Montreal in 1965, Alex along with his older brother Carlos experienced a trying childhood which fueled both his personal demons as well as his lyric and songwriting fluency.As a salvation, the brothers used music, and soccer, as a means to build confidence and find purpose. Alex's older brother Carlos played in several punk bands during the late 1970s prior to forming The Nils with his younger brother aged only 13. Carlos would bring home punk rock records such as The Clash, Sex Pistols and Stiff Little Fingers and play them for his brother. Alex Soria was won over by this then very new sound. Carlos soon bought him an $80 guitar and taught him 3 chords. Alex quickly excelled and by 1978 The Nils had formed and began playing live.From there, the brothers shared a songwriting partnership with Alex offering up the more fragile, introspective ballads and Carlos offering the more charged, anthemic social commentaries. This songwriting partnership would prove to be instrumental in The Nils footprint in rock n roll history. In 1982 the brothers saw this partnership come to fruition upon the release of \"Scratches and Needles\"(Alex Soria)for the BYO compilation \"Something to Believe In\" but band broke up shortly afterward. Luckily, Carlos convinced the remaining band members to continue playing as The Nils and they released \"Call of the Wild\" (Carlos Soria)for a Primitive Air Raid compilation. The band began to tour extensively and still managed to deliver a seminal power pop/punk rock EP entitled \"Paisley\" in 1984.By 1985, The Nils had befriended Ivan Doroschuk of Men Without Hats who loaned the band $3,500 loan to record the highly influential \"Sell Out Young\" EP. The album's success and critical acclaim began to draw the attention of a few major labels and by the following year, The Nils accepted an offer from a subsidiary of Profile Records to record the seminal self-titled LP \"The Nils\" (produced by Chris Spedding and award winning engineer Phil Burnett). This album included updated versions of the songs \"Daylight\" and \"Inbetweens\" from Sell Out Young, as well as eight other original songs. With this the band continued to garner critical acclaim and set off on a second North American tour before it being abruptly cancelled due to the label's bankruptcy. Bound by their five year contract with the now defunct label and now unable to release anything under The Nils name until the contract's expiration, the band broke up and went their separate ways with Carlos joining Naked Soul in Los Angeles, and Alex beginning a day job in Montreal. Without his band or older brother by his side to serve as his personal and professional manager, Alex began to lose hope regarding his ability to make his only calling, music, his career. Struggling to find solace, he began a lengthy battle with heroin addiction.In 1994 The Nils released \"Green Fields in Daylight\", a compilation of early recordings. The release included \"Call of the Wild\", the Nils demo tape \"Now\", \"Scratches and Needles\", and tracks from the \"Sell Out Young\" and \"Paisley\" eps. The album also included a radio interview with Carlos Soria. Later Alex, formed the band \"Chino\" in an effort to break away from The Nils and start anew. The band released the 6 song EP \"Mala Leche\" in 1999 and continued to play shows but never got garnered the attention of that of The Nils. In 2002, The Nils reformed with Carlos now on Bass, and ex Flounger and Chino guitar player and close friend of Alex, Mark Donato. The band began writing new songs and Alex finally seemed hopeful that this could be their second chance.On December 13, 2004, in a moment of fleeting desperation Alex Soria ended his life on a train track near his home in Montreal. He was 39 years old. Months later, musicians including Chris Spedding and John Kastner (Doughboys, Asexuals) held a sold out tribute concert in his name.In 2006 in honor of his younger brother, Carlos Soria released \"Next Of Kin\" an album featuring unreleased acoustic 4-track recordings by Alex and himself. The album showcased Alex's naturally introspective nature and perhaps finally gave the world a glimpse into the heart and mind of an artist who was so notoriously shy and private.Today, Alex Soria's legend lives on through his recordings that helped shape a sound so distinct it can be still found in those who followed closely behind."@en .

Kopylov studied for many years as a chorister and violinist in the Imperial Court Choir, where he would later teach for much of his life. (The Court Choir was modeled after the more famous one in Vienna, known today as the Vienna Boys Choir). He was unable to gain entrance to either of the major conservatories in Russia, but was nevertheless able to study composition privately with Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Anatoly Liadov. Kopylov gained a reputation as a symphonist and composer of songs. Through his friendship with Rimsky-Korsakov, he became interested in chamber music, writing four string quartets.

He currently teaches at Alperton Community School in Wembley.\u2018Toovey consciously places himself outside what he regards as useless or outmoded conventions, whilst reserving the right to draw on, allude to, shoplift from absolutely anywhere. Not only are Toovey\u2019s musical sympathies unusually diverse and deliberately unaligned to the readymade categories of our recent past (minimalism, neo-Romanticism, new complexity), but the fundamental stylistic \u201Cgesture\u201D can be as readily compared to the visual arts as to any music - to the work of Robert Motherwell, Barnett Newman, Robert Rauschenberg or Stanley HayterAndrew Toovey was born in London in 1962, and studied composition with Jonathan Harvey, Michael Finnissy and briefly with Morton Feldman. He has won a series of prestigious composition prizes including the Tippett Prize, Terra Nova Prize, the Bernard Shore Viola Composition Award and an RVW Trust Award.Toovey was associate composer for the Young Concert Artists Trust (YCAT) from 1993-5 and has been the artistic director of the new music ensemble IXION since 1987. He was composer-in-residence at the Banff Centre, Canada for four successive years with his two operas and music theatre works. Two CDs of his music were released on the Largo label in 1998. He has worked extensively on education projects for Glyndebourne Opera, English National Opera, Huddersfield Festival, the South Bank Centre and the London Festival Orchestra, and has been composer-in-residence at Opera Factory and the South Bank Summer School.Toovey's works have been performed throughout the UK, Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and the USA. His works have also been featured at the Bergen, Brighton, Gaudeamus, Huddersfield and ISCM festivals and the Darmstadt and Dartington International Summer School. His music has been frequently broadcast on BBC Radio 3 and various European radio stations.Toovey's work embraces a huge diversity of influences, from musical extremes such as Feldman and Finnissy, or the poetry of Artaud, Cummings and Rilke, to a passion for 20th century art - especially that by Bacon, Beuys, Davies, Hayter, Klee, Miro, Newman, Rauschenberg, Riley, Rothko and many more.Recent commissions have included Music for the Painter Jack Smith (Brighton Festival), Dutch Dykes (De Ereprijs), Self-portrait as a Tiger! (Ensemble Reconsil Wein), Going Home (Szymanowski String Quartet). He was commissioned by the BBC to write a viola concerto, premiered by Lawrence Power and the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra earlier this year in Glasgow. He is currently writing an orchestral suite based on music from his first opera UBU and a large orchestral work.Other commissions have included Acrobats, for COMA, mini opera I'll be there for you, commissioned by English Touring Opera, solo violin work Transparencies written for an exhibition of artist Julian Grater, and Noh for solo cello written for sculptor John Davies."@en .

They soon began writing original material and formed Mother Love Bone the same year, adding guitarist Bruce Fairweather and former 10 Minute Warning and Skin Yard drummer Greg Gilmore to the lineup. The following year, the band signed a deal with PolyGram, issuing a six-song EP, Shine, before going on to tour, supporting The Dogs D'Amour. Towards the end of the year, the band recorded their debut album, Apple, which was scheduled for release in 1990.Due to his struggle with drug addiction, Wood checked himself into rehab in 1989, hoping to get clean for the release of Mother Love Bone's debut album.

dbpedia:Arabella_Goddard	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Arabella Goddard (12 January 1836 \u2013 6 April 1922) was an English pianist of great renown in the middle to late 19th century.She was born and died in France. Her parents, Thomas Goddard, an heir to a Salisbury cutlery firm, and Arabella n\u00E9e Ingles, were part of an English community of expatriates living in Saint-Servan near Saint-Malo, Brittany. She remained very proud of her French background all her life, and spiced her conversation with French phrases . She had an older sister, Ann.At age six she was sent to Paris to study with Friedrich Kalkbrenner. She was feted as a child prodigy, and played for the French Royal Family, and Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric Chopin and George Sand (she would later also play for Queen Victoria). Her family suffered financial distress during the 1848 Revolution and had to return to England; there, Arabella had further lessons with Lucy Anderson and Sigismond Thalberg. She first appeared in public in 1850, under the conductor Michael William Balfe, at a Grand National Concert at Her Majesty's Theatre.Thalberg sent her to be tutored by James William Davison, the influential but staunchly conservative chief music critic for The Times. She made her formal debut on 14 April 1853, in Beethoven's \"Hammerklavier\" Sonata, the first time the work had been performed in England. She spent 1854 and 1855 in Germany and Italy. She played at a concert at the Leipzig Gewandhaus and was very favourably received by the German critics.She was one of the first pianists to play recitals from memory, although her concerto appearances were with the score in front.Arabella Goddard returned to England and gave concerts with the Philharmonic Society, at the Crystal Palace, and at the Monday Popular Concerts. In 1857 and 1858 she played all the late Beethoven sonatas in London, most of which were still complete novelties to her audiences, and many other works.In 1859 she married her mentor J. W. Davison. She was 23, he 46. In 1871 she was in the first group of recipients of the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society.From 1873 to 1876 she conducted a major tour, organised by Robert Sparrow Smythe, of the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore and Java. In America, the critics were less impressed by her playing of Romantic music, but liked her classical playing. This may have been due to Davison's influence on her: he did not approve of any composers after Mendelssohn. In June 1874, while returning to Townsville, Queensland from Java, her ship was wrecked, and she had to spend a night in an open boat in torrential rain, with Charles Blondin, who was also arriving for an Australian tour. In October 1875, she appeared in New York with Th\u00E9r\u00E8se Tietjens.In England, George Bernard Shaw was struck by her effortless ability to play the most complex pieces. He described Teresa Carre\u00F1o as \"a second Arabella Goddard\". She retired from performing in 1880.She was appointed a teacher at the Royal College of Music in 1883, its first year of operation.A number of composers dedicated pieces to her, including William Sterndale Bennett's Piano Sonata in A-flat, Op. 46 \"The Maid of Orleans\". She herself composed a small number of piano pieces, including a suite of six waltzes.After the birth of her two sons Henry and Charles, she separated from her husband, who died in 1885.

dbpedia:Carl_David_Stegmann	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Carl David Stegmann (1751 \u2013 May 27, 1826) was a German tenor, harpsichordist, conductor, and composer.He was born in Staucha near Meissen, the son of Johann Ehrenfried Stegmann and Anna Christiana Bretzner, and married Karoline Johanna Eleanore Linz producing two sons and four daughters. He received his initial musical training from the local organist at Staucha, then studied in Dresden with J.F. Zillich (from 1760), at the Kreuzschule (1766\u201370) and later under Homilius and the violinist H.F. Weisse. Thereafter he rose rapidly as singer, actor, and harpsichordist; he went to Breslau in 1772 (with the W\u00E4ser theatre company), K\u00F6nigsberg in 1773, Heilsberg in 1774 (as court harpsichordist to the Bishop of Ermeland), Danzig in 1775, K\u00F6nigsberg again in 1776 (with the Schuch company) and later appeared in Gotha (at the court theatre). From 1778 to 1783 he made the first of two extended visits to Hamburg, winning particular renown as a harpsichordist. By that time, six of his operas and Singspiels, first produced earlier in K\u00F6nigsberg and Danzig, were attracting performances elsewhere in northern Germany. In 1783 he left Hamburg to join the Grossmann company in Bonn. He then became attached to the court theatre at Mainz in association with which he made highly acclaimed guest appearances in Frankfurt. He sang in the first German-language Don Giovanni (Mainz, 13 Mar 1789), produced or conducted other operas by Mozart, Salieri, Gluck and Gassmann, composed incidental music (e.g. to B\u00FCrger's version of Macbeth, 30 Aug 1785) and acted in dramas by Lessing and Schiller.The summit of Stegmann's activities in Frankfurt was the production of his allegorical Singspiel Heinrich der L\u00F6we (15 July 1792) to commemorate the coronation of Emperor Franz II. By the time of his return to Hamburg in November 1792, he was esteemed as a leading operatic producer and adapter, which compensated for the declining vocal prowess that forced him to restrict his appearances to comic roles (Allgemeine Musik-Zeitung, i, 1798-9, col. 713). In 1798 he joined the directorate of the Hamburg theatre, remaining there until 1811; thereafter he moved to Bonn and attracted attention mainly as a composer of incidental music and a series of instrumental works (Allgemeine Musik-Zeitung, iv, 1801-2, col. 261), including keyboard and multiple concertos. His earlier close acquaintance with the operas of Gluck and Mozart, and his later keyboard arrangements (published by his friend Simrock) of Haydn's symphonies, Mozart's string quintets and Beethoven's Trios op. 9, enabled him to produce instrumental music notable for contrapuntal and textural ingenuity, combined with an imaginative, if sometimes overladen, instrumentation.As a composer for the theatre, Stegmann has attracted attention for his harmonic and tonal organisation and for using antecedent forms of leitmotif, showing an early interest in dramatic and psychological continuity. He died in Bonn.His daughter Margaretha Amalie von Neumann sang in the Royal Court Opera in Munich, becoming Court Singer to the King of Bavaria, Max-Josef, in 1812, and later director of the Court Theatre in Munich until she died in 1839."@en .

As funds ran out, Lamoureux took up posts at the Op\u00E9ra-Comique (1876) and the Op\u00E9ra (1877-79) which were short-lived, due to Lamoureux's tendency to quarrel over their productions.Lamoureux then drew up a contract with the Th\u00E9\u00E2tre du Ch\u00E2teau d\u2019Eau to give weekly symphony concerts. The Soci\u00E9t\u00E9 des Nouveaux-Concerts (which became known as the Concerts Lamoureux) was directed by Lamoureux from 1881 until 1897, when he was succeeded by Camille Chevillard, his son-in-law. These concerts contributed greatly to popularizing Wagner's music in Paris.In fact Lamoureux's advocacy of Wagner's music was untiring. When he gave the first French performance of Wagner's Lohengrin at the Eden-Th\u00E9\u00E2tre in 1887, the Chauvinists held street demonstrations outside denouncing the performance as an unpatriotic act. Despite this setback, two years later the work was restaged at the Op\u00E9ra, which now made Lamoureux its musical director.In 1893 Lamoureux made a tour of Russia. He visited London on several occasions, and gave successful concerts with his orchestra at the Queen's Hall, on one occasion sharing the stage with Sir Henry Wood and Wood's own orchestra. Lamoureux died at Paris in December 1899; Tristan und Isolde had been at last heard in Paris, owing to his initiative and under his direction. After conducting one of the performances of this masterpiece he was taken ill and succumbed in a few days, having had the consolation before his death of witnessing the triumph of the cause he had so courageously championed."@en .

His paternal grandfather, born in Leipzig but who later settled in Britain, was part of an old German family that had, since 1715, held a Barony in the Holy Roman Empire. This grandfather, Edward, married Kate Lupton, born into the progressive and political Lupton family, and educated at the school of her relative Rachel Martineau. Edward died in 1889, but Kate survived him until 1913, the eve of the First World War, and insisted in her will that their only son, John Edward von Schunck, change his surname to that of her father, the former Mayor of Leeds. Thus he and his children acquired by Royal Licence the name Darnton. John Edward had two sisters, both of whom married, making Christian Darnton the nephew of Albert Kitson, 2nd Baron Airedale.The family was extremely well-off and he was educated at home by a governess until he was nine, when he began composing.Darton composed the overture Stalingrad during World War II, and works for different combinations. He had joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1941. His Communist views may have later hurt his popularity and led to his becoming relatively obscure.

She was born in Pontotoc, Mississippi, on July 15, 1923, and died in Memphis, Tennessee, on October 14, 2004. Jackson founded the Moon Records label in Memphis in 1956 after a few years of recording demos at Sam Phillips' Memphis Recording Service and Sun Records Studio. Unable to break into the Sun Records label's stable of male artists, she received the advice and assistance of RCA Records' Chet Atkins in forming this new label to release her music. She began releasing and promoting on the label singles she recorded in her home studio, serving as engineer, producer and arranger. The artists recorded included her and a small family of early rock and roll, rockabilly, and country music performers she recruited from several Southern states. Tav Falco's Panther Burns and Alex Chilton helped create new interest in her career in the 1980s when they began covering some of her Moon label's old singles such as \"Dateless Night\", a song she originally wrote in the 1950s for Florida artist Allen Page. Jackson then began playing occasional shows in the 1980s with her signature red Hagstrom electric guitar as a solo artist in Memphis, Hoboken, New York, and Chicago nightclubs. She recorded new material on her label with Memphis musicians Colonel Robert Morris and Bob Holden, becoming known as a \"rock-and-roll granny\" solo guitar instrumentalist. She appeared in 1991 and 1992 on national talk shows like Late Night with David Letterman and in a television commercial duelling with rockabilly artist Brian Setzer on guitar.In the late 1990s, Cordell co-wrote and played with the Rockabilly icon, Colonel Robert Morris in Memphis. Colonel Robert also helped edit the book based on her life and career.Her Moon Records label was the oldest continuously operating label in Memphis at the time of her death in 2004. The 50's Rock on the Moon of Memphis, Tennessee + an Oddity, a compilation album of the label's 1950s singles, was released on vinyl in the early 1980s and was later sold on compact disc until her death in 2004. The original 1950s vinyl singles compiled on that album have been displayed at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. She also released video singles through her label in the 1990s, including \"Football Widow\" and filmmaker Dan Rose's production of \"The Split.\" Her marketing of her own video singles, as opposed to marketing them in multiple-song video collections, is reputed to be another first in her innovative lifetime of doing things her own way, bucking the trends of standard industry practice.Jackson's only solo full length album to date, Cordell Jackson \u2014 Live in Chicago was released on Bughouse Records in 1997.

dbpedia:Dave_Willetts	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Dave Willetts (born 24 June 1952 in Birmingham) is an English singer and actor known for having leading roles in West End musicals.Willetts is something of an enigma in that he has had no formal singing, dancing, or acting lessons. Before he was 20 he rarely visited the theatre. It was while he was working as a quality control supervisor at an engineering firm in the Midlands that he became interested in amateur dramatics. He came to the attention of Bob Hamlyn, artistic director of the Belgrade Theatre, in Coventry after his sensitive and emotional portrayal of Charlie Gordon in the Charles Strouse musical, Flowers for Algernon. Hamlyn cast him as \"third flunky from the left\" in another show by Strouse, Annie. It was at this time, while Willetts was in his thirties, that he began his meteoric rise to the top.Director Trevor Nunn put Willetts into the chorus of the original London production of Les Mis\u00E9rables and within a year he was understudy to Colm Wilkinson in the lead role of Jean Valjean, which Willetts eventually took over when Wilkinson left in 1986 to join the Broadway company. In 1987, when Michael Crawford departed London for the US premier of Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera, Willetts succeeded him at Her Majesty's Theatre in the West End's hottest ticket. He subsequently played the role of the Phantom in Manchester on the UK tour to critical acclaim, winning an Evening News Theatre Award. In 1990, he was given his first opportunity to originate a role when he appeared opposite Petula Clark in Someone Like You, a musical for which she had composed the score. Since then, Willetts has appeared in a concert version of Jesus Christ Superstar, taken the lead role in Leicester Haymarket's acclaimed production of Stephen Sondheim's Sweeney Todd, appeared as Old Deuteronomy in the 20th anniversary production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats in London, and as Jean Valjean in the 10th anniversary production of Les Mis\u00E9rables in Sydney, Australia. He created the role of Heathcliff in the studio recording of Bernard J. Taylor musical version of Wuthering Heights.In 2004 he appeared in the West End production of Ragtime alongside Maria Friedman. In December of the same year he appeared as Captain Hook in Peter Pan in Bromley. Most recently he has played the starring role in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers in the West End (2006). He recently played the role of Emile de Becque in a UK touring production of Rogers and Hammerstein's South Pacific, which toured the UK until July 2008.He appeared in a scaled down production of Sunset Boulevard at the Comedy Theatre (now The Harold Pinter) as Max in 2008-09. Dave is currently reprising the role of Julian Marsh in a UK Tour of 42nd Street for UK Productions. Dave appeared in this production in 2007 as a replacement for Paul Nicholas.

dbpedia:Dominick_Argento	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Dominick Argento (born October 27, 1927, York, Pennsylvania) is an American composer, best known for his lyric operatic and choral music. Among his best known pieces are the operas Postcard from Morocco, Miss Havisham's Fire, and The Masque of Angels, The Aspern Papers (opera), as well as the song cycles Six Elizabethan Songs and From the Diary of Virginia Woolf; the latter earned him the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1975. In a predominantly tonal context, his music freely combines tonality, atonality and a lyrical use of twelve-tone writing, though none of Argento's music approaches the experimental avant garde fashions of the post World War II era.As a student in the 1950s, Argento divided his time between America and Italy, and his music is greatly influenced both by his instructors in the United States and his personal affection for Italy, particularly the city of Florence. Many of Argento's works were written in Florence, where he spends a portion of every year. He has been a professor (and, more recently, a professor emeritus) at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, and he frequently remarks that he finds that city to be tremendously supportive of his work and that he thinks his musical development would have been impeded had he stayed in the high-pressure world of East Coast music. He was one of the founders of the Center Opera Company (now the Minnesota Opera), and indeed Newsweek once referred to the Twin Cities as \"Argento's town.\"Argento has written fourteen operas as well as major song cycles, orchestral works, and many choral pieces for small and large forces, many of which were commissioned for and premiered by Minnesota-based artists. He has referred to his wife, the soprano Carolyn Bailey, as his muse, and she was a frequent performer of his works. She died on February 2, 2006."@en .

His father, Doyle Bramhall, Sr., played drums for blues legends Lightnin' Hopkins and Freddie King and was a lifelong collaborator with childhood friends Stevie Ray Vaughan and Jimmie Vaughan.Doyle is known as one of the few guitarists who plays with his instrument strung upside-down. He plays left-handed, but the instrument is strung for a right-handed player. This unusual arrangement of the strings gives his playing a unique sound, because he bends the strings by pulling them downwards, rather than by pushing them upwards. Other guitarists who use this technique of bending include the late Canadian blues guitarist Jeff Healey, who played with his instrument flat on his lap due to blindness.When Doyle was 18 he toured with Jimmie Vaughan\u2019s band The Fabulous Thunderbirds. Two years later he co-founded the blues rock band Arc Angels with fellow Austinite Charlie Sexton and members from Stevie Ray Vaughan\u2019s rhythm section - Chris Layton and Tommy Shannon. Following the 1999 release of Jellycream, Bramhall's solo debut for RCA, he received phone calls from both Roger Waters and Eric Clapton. Bramhall joined Waters on the In the Flesh tour and Clapton recorded his songs on Riding With The King, a collaboration with B.B. King. Doyle has continued to tour and record with Clapton as a guitarist, songwriter and, more recently, co-producer.In addition to collaborating with artists such as T-Bone Burnett, Elton John, Derek Trucks, Susan Tedeschi, Gary Clark, Jr., Gregg Allman, Dr. John, Allen Toussaint, Billy Preston, Erykah Badu, Questlove and Meshell Ndegeocello, Bramhall has produced several records, including Sheryl Crow's 100 Miles from Memphis in 2011.Bramhall recently completed co-production on Eric Clapton's current release Old Sock and toured internationally with Clapton in 2013.

Another contemporary Turin performer, Fred Buscaglione, was also starting his singing occupation in the same fashion. Music impresario/conductor Carlo Prato, who had earlier promoted a Dutch sister act into the very popular Trio Lescano, heard Bonino and arranged an audition for him at the Italian state radio company EIAR. His broadcast debut came on 5 January 1941 with the song Tango Argentino. It was an instant success and other hits followed, including La Paloma, Se Fossi Milionario, La Famiglia Canterina (with Trio Lescano), A Zonzo, Musica Maestro, Il Giovanotto Matto, Ti Comprer\u00F2 l'Armonica and Conosci Mia Cugina?. During the 1940s, Bonino, dubbed \"Mister Swing\", rivaled only Natalino Otto and Alberto Rabagliati in terms of popularity.In 1947, two years after the end of World War II, he embarked on a long tour of Latin America, performing in Peru, Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Venezuela, Mexico and Cuba, where he and actress/singer Tina de Mola took Havana theatergoers by storm with their song Chinito chinita.In 1952 Ernesto Bonino moved to the United States and realized his dream of singing jazz standards in the best clubs of New York, Chicago and Miami. He made a brief comeback to Italy in 1955 for the Garinei and Giovannini musical comedy La Granduchessa e i camerieri (The Grand Duchess and the Valets). When the run was finished, he returned to the U.S. and remained until 1958. His sole participation in the renowned Sanremo Music Festival came in 1962, when he placed third with Gondol\u00EC, Gondol\u00E0, written by the duo Carosone-Nisa. After the contest, Carosone hired him for the European tour of his band.After that successful tour, however, changing musical tastes slowly led to the fading of Bonino's popularity and, in 1986, he underwent a surgical procedure which resulted in the loss of his voice. By December 2000, when he was nearly eighty, the state recognized his artistic merit and contribution to Italian culture by granting him a special government life pension.Ernesto Bonino was 86 years old when he died at the Giuseppe Verdi Retirement Home for Artists in Milan, where he had been residing since 23 April 2003."@en .

Much of the album was recorded live onto a cassette boom box, then transferred to computer. Although billed as an album of supposed demos, it was a completed work.The self-titled EP which appeared in 2004 was a return to the more lush production of the first album. It was recorded in Kabourek's spare bedroom.In 2005, Ernest Jenning offered a (re-)mastered reissue of Golden Sand and the Grandstand with all-new artwork by Frank Holmes (who was the artist for the 1966 Beach Boys album Smile).Fizzle Like a Flood recorded another album, tentatively titled Love (not to be confused with the single of the same name), which has never been released.In 2009 the song \"Something More\" was used in the feature-length movie, April Showers.Although Kabourek recorded alone, he would often take to the stage in Omaha and Lincoln with a variety of musicians including: Travis Sing, Matt Bowen, James Carrig, Bob Carrig, Jesse Otto, and Anthony Knuppel of Shelter Belt.Kabourek is currently the singer/drummer in the rock trio At Land, and has another solo project called The Dull Cares."@en .

Sneed joined their new band, Three Dog Night, which became a huge commercial success in the late 1960s and early 1970s. After Three Dog Night broke up in 1977, Sneed continued to work with other groups, including an extended tour with The Ohio Players. He and other backing musicians from Three Dog Night also worked together in a short-lived group named SS Fools. He reappeared briefly with the reincarnated Three Dog Night in the mid-1980s.

dbpedia:Francesco_Rasi	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Francesco Rasi (14 May 1574 \u2013 30 November 1621) was an Italian composer, singer (tenor), chitarrone player, and poet.Rasi was born in Arezzo. He studied at the University of Pisa and in 1594 he was studying with Giulio Caccini. He may have been in Carlo Gesualdo's retinue when he went to Ferrara for his wedding in 1594. In 1598 he joined the court of Duke Vincent I in Mantua, and probably served the Gonzaga family the rest of his life, with whom he travelled all over Italy and as far afield as Poland. He sang in the first performances of Jacopo Peri's Euridice and Caccini's Il rapimento di Cefalo in 1600. In 1607 he created the title role in Claudio Monteverdi's Orfeo, and in 1608 sang in the first performances of Marco da Gagliano's Dafne.In 1610 in Tuscany Rasi and his accomplices were sentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered for the murder of his stepmother's servant and the attempted murder of his stepmother; however because of the protection of the Gonzaga family he escaped, and his sentence was eventually annulled with the agreement that he never return to Arezzo, his birthplace.He wrote an opera, Cibele, ed Ati, which seems not to have been performed and whose music does not survive, and another libretto, Elvidia rapita. He published poetry, including in the anthology La cetra di sette corde, and a good deal of monody which survives in the anthologies Vaghezze di musica (1608) and Madrigali (1610). Almost all of these are written for tenor voice, suggesting that they were written to display Rasi's own skill as a singer, and they follow in the style of Caccini's compositions.Rasi was a well-respected singer, whose skill in ornamentation and diminution, beautiful voice, and ability to sing with grace and feeling, led to him being involved in the first performances of many of the first operas."@en .

dbpedia:Frank_Sampedro	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Frank \"Poncho\" Sampedro (born February 25, 1949) is an American guitarist and member of the rock band Crazy Horse, known mainly for its longtime collaboration with singer-songwriter Neil Young.Born in West Virginia and raised in Detroit, Sampedro moved to California as soon as he was old enough to drive. Having spent the next few years playing in different bands, Sampedro joined Crazy Horse in 1975 to record Zuma, after being introduced to the band by Billy Talbot in November 1974, exactly two years after the death of original Crazy Horse guitarist Danny Whitten. With the addition of Sampedro on rhythm guitar, Crazy Horse developed a new, rigid sound (as opposed to the more free-form approach of the Whitten era) that served as a seminal influence in the development of grunge and noise rock while also enabling Neil Young to focus more on his lead playing. Although Crazy Horse did not work with Young for much of the 1980s, Sampedro remained an integral part of Young's circle throughout the epoch, playing on several solo albums (most notably Freedom) and tours; his proficiency in emerging computer technology allowed him to cultivate a second career with the Young organization that would blossom in the years thereafter.For many years, he worked as an engineer on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno under bandleader Kevin Eubanks, running the ensemble's MIDI board.

His popularity peaked in 1990, when his song \"Biser Balkanski\" won 1st prize at the Folk Fest Valandovo 1990 Song Festival, an annual competition in which singers from the former Yugoslavia competed to find the best song. The song became an instant classic in the Republic of Macedonia, even becoming somewhat of an anthem to a nation just starting off after its breakup from Yugoslavia. Nikolovski was also given the nickname \"Biser Balkanski\" following the song. Throughout the 1990s, Nikolovski went on to release several other hits, but none would measure up to the success that he found with \"Biser Balkanski\". In 1992, Nikolovski took part in the Canberra '92 Festival, a concert similar to the annual Valandovo song festival, with the song \"Od Majka Nema Pomila\".Nikolovski's popularity declined as time progressed, and by the start of the 21st century, he has virtually disappeared from the public eye."@en .

dbpedia:Hans_Abrahamsen	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Hans Abrahamsen (born 23 December 1952) is a Danish composer. Born in Copenhagen, Abrahamsen first got to know music through playing the French horn at school. He went on to study music theory at the Royal Danish Academy of Music. His music is inspired by his mentors Per N\u00F8rg\u00E5rd and Pelle Gudmundsen-Holmgreen, who were two of his composition teachers, and in the 1980s he became close both personally and stylistically (partly through another period of study) to Gy\u00F6rgy Ligeti.Abrahamsen is considered to have been part of a trend called the \"New Simplicity\", which arose in the mid-1960s as a reaction against the complexity and perceived aridity of the Central European avant-garde. Abrahamsen\u2019s first works conformed to the tenets of this movement, which was a Danish reaction against the complexity emanating from central Europe, particularly the circle around the Darmstadt School. For Abrahamsen this meant adopting an almost naive simplicity of expression, as in his orchestral piece Skum (\"Foam\", 1970). His style soon altered and developed, at first through a personal dialogue with Romanticism (audible in works such as the orchestral Nacht und Trompete (1984)), and later\u2014after a hiatus of around a decade in which he composed little and released nothing\u2014into something entirely personal, combining a modernist stringency and economy into a larger individual musical universe. Notable works since his return to composition include a piano concerto written for his wife Anne-Marie Abildskov, and the extended chamber work Schnee, where the paring-down of material appears to reach a new extreme.Abrahamsen's Let me tell you, for soprano and orchestra, was premiered on 20 December 2013 by the Berlin Philharmonic, with soprano soloist Barbara Hannigan (whom the work is dedicated to), conducted by Andris Nelsons."@en .

dbpedia:Henry_Halstead	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Henry Halstead (November 16, 1897 \u2013 March 19, 1984) was a U.S. bandleader.Henry Halstead's Orchestra began in early 1922 and over the next 20 years Halstead's band engagements extended from coast to coast, including the Blossom Room at Hotel Roosevelt, New York City; the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, California; the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco; the Blackstone Hotel in Chicago; and a season at \"Fatty\" Arbuckle's \"Plantation\" in Culver City where such entertainers as Al Jolson, Sophie Tucker, Gus Edwards, and Leatrice Joy were headliners on his shows. Henry Halstead had from 15 to 20 bandmembers at any given time. Halstead's orchestra appeared in numerous short subjects on the screen and has made over 100 phonograph records, mainly with Victor Records. In addition, Halstead appeared in short films released by RKO Radio. Following their rise to national fame over the air and in the grill rooms on the West Coast, Henry Halstead and his band gained the reputation as being the \"Favorite Band of Movieland\". During his career as the West Coast's premier dance orchestra Hank Halstead's boys played for nearly all the movie people at their private entertainments. Among the names of those who became Halstead fans were Sylvia Sidney, Fredric March, Claudette Colbert, Kay Francis, Rudolph Valentino, Roscoe Arbuckle, Maurice Chevalier, Clark Gable, Norma Shearer, Greta Garbo, Clive Brook, Gary Cooper, Marian Nixon, Jack Oakie, Buddy Rogers, and Ruth Chatterton.Hollywood actor Lew Ayres was discovered in the Henry Halstead band in 1927. Ayres said \"I was a member of Henry Halstead's orchestra in 1927 at the Mission Beach Ballroom, San Diego, Calif....summer. My instruments were tenor banjo, long-neck banjo and guitar. After a hiatus, I rejoined Mr. Halstead with a new group, including Phil Harris, on New Years Eve the same year for the opening night of the Beverly Wilshire Hotel... a memorable occasion.\" Henry Halstead is given credit for making the first Hollywood Vitaphone movie short with Warner Brothers in 1927 called Carnival Night in Paris where Lew Ayres was discovered playing banjo. The three music selections for the Vitaphone production where listed as follows: 1. Volga Boatman, 2. At Sundown, 3. Rosy Cheeks.Halstead was on the cover of Billboard issue of July 27, 1935 at that time known as Henry \"Hank\" Halstead and His Cocoanut Grove Orchestra playing at the Hotel-Park Central, New York.Phil Harris played drums and Red Nichols played trumpet as they were members of Henry Halstead's band in the 1920s. Cliff Arquette an actor, comedian, was also a night club pianist, and joined the Henry Halstead Orchestra in 1923.Halstead recorded for Victor Records, and broadcast on all major radio networks, such as Columbia, National, and Mutual Broadcasting Companies. Halstead led his band and played violin. The original Halstead violin still exists and has dozens of band member signatures on the violin. Henry was considered one of the best young band leaders and gave his dance patrons plenty of entertainment. His music maintained excellent rhythm and a crowded floor throughout the night stood testimony that he was playing good dance music. Henry Halstead was born November 16, 1897 in El Paso, Texas and died on March 19, 1984 in California. As a young boy, Halstead learned to play violin. After studying the violin for 10 years, Hank Halstead turned professional when 19 playing clubs and hotels at the tables. In 1919, Henry Halstead played violin with 2 other men that went on to become famous Big Band Leaders, Abe Lyman and Gus Arnheim. The 3 young men played in a band together at the Sunset Inn in Santa Monica, California. Abe Lyman played drums and Gus Arnheim played piano. Roy Fox, not well known in America but later a ranking bandmaster in England, played the trumpet on occasion with them. Even early on Halstead dressed the part, a tuxedo was a must and he must have worn out a few of them over the next 20 years. In 1923 Halstead, then director of the Palais Royal Orchestra, predicts for the coming year that even though dance steps may change, the music as far as tempo and rhythm will remain about the same as in 1922. And jazz, minus the shrieking and wailing, toned down with even a touch more of the classical than the case in the year now coming to a close, will continue to reign supreme in the popularity of dance fans. \"Balance of harmony is the secret.\" Mr. Halstead said. \"Careful selection of instruments and musicians are next in importance, but unless harmony is perfectly balanced that soft, dreamy effect so necessary in the modern fox trot is lost.\" The Buescher phone, an unusual instrument for a dance orchestra, is featured in the Palais Royal Orchestra.Henry Halstead was married to blues vocalist Marjorie Whitney who sang with the King's Jesters. The early Henry Halstead Orchestra during the early 1920s was enormously successful at the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco for about three years. This was the early days of radio, and he had the good fortune to broadcast over the very powerful (for those days) KGO in San Francisco. He was \"on\" for about an hour a night, six nights a week. As a consequence, his band became the best known organization in the western United States and Hawaii. This band broke up in the late summer of 1925. Hank decided that he would go out on his own - form a new band, literally \"hire a hall\" and run his own enterprise.. The band consisted of: Ted Schilling, Glenn Hopkins, Ross Dugat, Ernie Reed, Chuck Moll, Abe Maule, Hal Chanslor, Zebe Mann, Phil Harris and Craig Leach. When they joined Halstead in Seattle the band was a huge success. In the spring of 1926, the Halstead band came to Los Angeles to play Miller's Lafayette. Red Nichols joined the band for this opening.Many vocalists and entertainers performed with the Henry Halstead Orchestra. Maxine Harding with her deep-dyed blues singing was a Soloist with Henry Halstead's Orchestra. Clarence Rand's voice also was featured, so was Myrtle Harwin, Niela Goodelle, Margaret Reed, Peggy Mann."@en .

At age 14, Kotzschmar went to Dresden to study with Julius Otto, a choral conductor who was the cantor at the Dresden Kreuzkirche. He studied with Otto for five years, then emigrated to America with a group of other musicians from Dresden who called themselves the Saxonia Band. The group toured New York and Philadelphia with Fry's Italian Opera, then split up when the show folded in Boston.While in Boston, Kotzschmar met Cyrus Libby Curtis, an amateur musician from Portland, Maine, who suggested he move there to find work. Kotzschmar arrived in Portland in July 1849 and lived with the Curtis family for his first year there.

With the exception of Scott Joplin, Lampe was possibly the most famous composer of ragtime songs of the early-20th century.Lampe was born in Ribe, Denmark to Christian and Sophia Lampe. In 1873, his family moved with his family to St. Paul, Minnesota, where his father took over leadership of the Great Western Band. Lampe was a child prodigy on the violin and became the first chair violinist for the Minneapolis Symphony at age 16. He met and married his wife, Josephine, while receiving tuition in Chicago in 1888. In the early 1890s, he and his wife moved to Buffalo where they had four children, Walter, Petra, Dorothy and Joseph Dell (known later as \"Dell\"). At this time, he began composing and publishing his own music and led a dance orchestra.In 1900, a year after the success of Joplin's \"Maple Leaf Rag\", he published his most successful and enduring song \"Creole Belles\", a rag or cakewalk that sold more than a million copies in sheet music. The song was recorded by Sousa's Band in 1902 and has been a staple of jazz bands and ragtime pianists into the 21st century. He also collected, and may possibly have composed, Mysterioso Pizzicato, the piece of photoplay music whose main motif became a standard cue for stealth and villainy and has seen \"hundreds of tongue-in-cheek uses\" in features and cartoons."@en .

Born in Dartmoor, England, he was known to have lived in London in 1791 and early 1792, but went to New York in September of that year. He stayed in New York until 1811, conducting a theater orchestra and composing and arranging music for local ballad operas and musical events. He also gave lessons and sold musical instruments and publications in his \u201Cmusical repository\u201D.He began participating in the musical activities of Boston as early as 1805, and moved there in 1811, pursuing the same activities as he had done in New York. For the rest of his life he traveled between the two cities. After an unsuccessful operation in New York in early 1827, he was brought back to Boston, where died a few months later. His place of burial is not known.Most of his publications were the works of British composers, including William Shield, James Hook and even Haydn and Mozart. He also published about 160 of his own works, including instrumental, keyboard, and vocal compositions. Like other American music teachers of the same era, he also produced several pedagogical books.One of his most well-known works today is The Battle of Trenton, a keyboard sonata written in 1797 and dedicated to George Washington. This sonata contains numerous short sections with descriptive titles, such as \"The Army in Motion,\" \"Attack\u2014Cannons\u2014Bomb,\" \"Flight of the Hessians,\" \"Trumpets of Victory,\" and so forth, including one section using the tune \"Yankee Doodle.\" When the harpsichordist Ralph Kirkpatrick revived the piece in 1940, Time magazine commented that \"Though written for the most part in the measured, tinkling idiom of 18th-Century English salon music, The Battle of Trenton still preserved a smoldering crash and rumble reminiscent of the early works of Ludwig van Beethoven.\" The piece has been arranged for band and can be heard as performed by the Goldman Band on the album \"Footlifters - A Century of American Marches.\" It was also recorded by organist E. Power Biggs, who narrated his own performance.Hewitt was especially influential in musical life of New York in the early nineteenth century. Four of his children became prominent musicians: his son John Hill Hewitt (1801\u20131890) was an important composer, his daughter Sophia Henrietta Emma Hewitt (1799\u20131845) was a well known concert pianist, his son James Lang Hewitt (1803\u201353) was a successful music publisher, and another son George Washington Hewitt (1811\u201393) taught and composed music.

dbpedia:Jaufre_de_Pons	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Jaufre de Pons or Pon (French: Geoffroy or Geoffroi, modern Occitan: Jaufr\u00E9, modern English: Geoffrey) was a 13th-century knight and troubadour from the castle of Pons in the March of Poitou in the Saintonge. He composed tensos with his castellan, Rainaut de Pons. There is joint vida of Jaufre and Rainaut. Only two of his tensos survive and only one that has survived is with Rainaut (\"Seign'en Jaufre, respondetz mi, si\u00B7us platz\"). The other is a partimen with Guiraut Riquier (\"Guiraut Riquier, diatz me,\" composed probably 1270 or 1280\u20131). Jaufre's part in the debate consists in asking plain youthful questions about love only to receive the bitter and experienced answers of Guiraut in proverbial form.Jaufre was probably the husband of Isabeau, daughter of Henry II of Rodez, a patron of troubadours. In 1292 he rendered homage to the lord of Ch\u00E2teauroux. Some scholars have suspected that there were more than one Jaufre de Pons (one from the Saintonge and another from the Toulousain). One Jaufre has been placed as early as 1200\u20131220.

BBC commissions include the orchestral works Mutations I (1969), Aurora (1973), Scenario (1975), Praeludium (1975), Memoria (1978) and Limina Lucis (1982). Other works include a Piano Concerto (1989), Duologue for violin and piano (1971), Scena for violin and piano (1988), Teneritas for flute and piano (1997), Sonante for clarinet and piano (1986 - for Thea King), Cantus for clarinet and piano (1996), a Piano Trio (1983), a Wind Quintet (1986), several mixed ensemble pieces including Time-Passage (1977), Stratos (1979), Epitaph for Abelard and Heloise (1979) and Litania (1993), piano works including Tableau (1980), Fantasy (1983), Threnody (1990 - all for Jana Frenklova), Trilogy (1992), Musica Aeterna (1997) and Sereno (2004), organ works including Mutations II (1971), Momentum (1977) and Esultante (1977 - these last two for Gillian Weir), Dreams, Dances and Lullabies for harp (1990), Silentia Noctis for high voice and piano (1989), and many choral works, notably Carmen Paschale (1981), Hymnus Ante Somnum (1985), Sequentia ad Sancte Michaele (1985), Westminster Mass (1990 - for Martin Neary), Recordatio (1999) and a sequence of eleven Sacred Chants (2005). Lewis's music is characterised by rhythmic energy and harmonic complexity alternating with extreme stillness; latterly his music has tended towards greater simplicity and tranquillity and it often appears to inhabit a twilight world of dreams. However, he has achieved this simplicity through a process of constant refinement of his compositional technique, rather than any rejection of his earlier complexity.Ivan March in Gramophone magazine described a recent CD release of Epitaph for Abelard and Heloise, Litania and Musica Aeterna as \u201C\u2026a disc not to be missed by anyone who cares about communicative 20th-century music.\u201D (July 2005)"@en .

dbpedia:Jimi_Mbaye	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Mamadou \"Jimi\" Mbaye is a Senegalese guitarist best known for his work with Youssou N'dour. Mbaye has developed a unique Senegalese guitar style in which he makes his Fender Stratocaster sound like local instruments such as the kora or xalam.Mbaye is very different from other guitarists because of his unique style of playing guitar. Youssou Ndour used to say \"no one, no one plays guitar like Jimi Mbaye. His playing style is unique\". Mbaye succeeded to transpose the African traditional sounds of khalam (Ngoni) and kora onto his electric Fender Stratocaster. Jimi has also proven to be good singer, very melodic, a true harmonicist. Carlos Santana and Mbaye met during a tour in Los Angeles where Carlos acknowledged that: \"Jimi is a very special and incredible guitarist\".Mbaye has released three solo albums, \"Dakar Heart\", \"Yaye Digalma\" and \"Khare Dounya\". The latter was recorded in Jimi's new studio Studio Dogo, in which he produces other artists. At ten years old Mbaye built his first guitar out of fishing line and gasoline cans. At twenty he'd scraped up enough money to buy a second hand Fender Stratocaster. Mbaye was just as determined to get a guitar as he was to make it in the competitive Dakar music scene. Early on he met Youssou N'Dour and together they became rising stars on Senegal's club scene, playing mbalax music. They created the \"Super Etoile\" band together in 1979 and have been musically inseparable for all these years.Mbaye recorded six top-selling major-label albums with N'Dour before taking a leave of absence to record his own solo album, released in 1997, Dakar Heart. Recorded at N'Dour's Studio Xippi, Dakar Heartfeatures N'Dour's band \"Super Etoile\". Mbaye is back at N'Dour's side and is very much an integral part of Youssou's \"Super Etoile\" band these days. In fact, Youssou often travels abroad only with Mbaye as acoustic guitar accompanist, as he did in June 1998 for performances in Paris as guests of Brazilian performer Gilberto Gil at the Olympia Theatre.A member of Youssou N'Dour's Super Etoile Band since 1979, Mbaye is one of Senegal's most influential guitarists. Often compared to Jimi Hendrix and Robert Johnson, Mbaye has forged a unique blend of traditional Senegalese roots music and American pop and R&B. Recording a solo album, Dakar Heart, with help from Super Etoile Band musicians in 1997, Mbaye showcased his inventive, kora-derived guitar playing and singing in Wolof, English, and French. Billboard called him \"a prodigious world talent,\" while Rhythm referred to him as \"one of Senegal's most exciting musicians.\" Music has played an ongoing role in Mbaye's life. As a youngster, he performed on a self-invented instrument made from discarded garbage cans and nylon fishing line in the streets of Dakar. By the age of 20, he had graduated to a Fender Stratocaster electric guitar. Mbaye continues to be the backbone of N'Dour's band. In addition to co-writing the 1994 single \"Mame Bamba,\" he has made valuable contributions to six N'Dour recordings. Mbaye and N'Dour have increasingly performed as a duo. In 1998, they opened the show for Brazilian guitarist Gilberto Gil at the Olympic Theater in Paris.Mbaye is one of Africa's greatest guitarists. He has played in Youssou N'dour's Super Etoile since 1979. Now he has a solo album, Dakar Heart, on which he sings as well as plays guitar. The album is available from Shanachie Records, catalog #64094. In Europe, it's distributed by BMG France.Dakar Heart skillfully blends Senegalese mbalax with American pop & R&B for a powerful new sound.Here's what some of the critics are saying about Dakar Heart:- UCLA DAILY BRUIN (Los Angeles) Oct. 13, 1997\"Poetic and achingly beautiful, Dakar Heart takes 'world music' to new heights. Alternately political and personal, and always passionate, the record reveals Mbaye as a true artist and lyricist. His songs are filled with love, hope and a desperate cry for peace, whether it be peace between nations or peace with one's soul. Dakar Heart is an elegant masterpiece.\"- BILLBOARD magazine, Oct. 4 1997\"The solo debut for Youssou N'dour's guitarist Jimi Mbaye shines a deserved spotlight on a prodigious world music talent.\"- RHYTHM MUSIC magazine, March 1998\"Mbaye continues to prove he is one of Senegal's most exciting musicians\"- RHYTHM MUSIC magazine, March 1998Jimi Mbaye is a Senegalese guitarist best known for his work with Youssou N'dour.

He recorded this album with his band \u201CGroup Dogo\u201D. It\u2019s an album where Mbaye shows really his musicality. He started to tour with his band around the country (Senegal) and the West African region.Since he had his studio Mbaye often collaborated with many artists from Africa and the rest of the world.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/John_Coates_(tenor)>	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"John Coates (29 June 1865 \u2013 16 August 1941) was a leading English tenor, who sang in opera and oratorio and on the concert platform. His repertoire ranged from Bach and Purcell to contemporary works, and embraced the major heldentenor roles in Richard Wagner's operas. For more than 40 years, with only a four-year interruption for military service during World War I, he overcame the limitations of a voice that was not naturally large by impressing listeners with his intense artistic expression, lively diction, musical versatility and memorable stage presence. Coates spent some time on the European continent, toured Australia and South Africa in 1912\u201313 and performed in North America in the 1890s and again in 1925. He performed most often, however, in his native country and became a beloved figure at England's regional music festivals. Elgar's Dream of Gerontius was one of his specialties. After 1921, he limited his performances to the concert stage and recitals, still performing a wide-ranging repertoire, but championing English composers. A dispute with music publishers about royalties clouded his later years."@en .

He spent his early career in the 1970s primarily in Vancouver, Canada, playing in local rhythm and blues bands and strip clubs, as well as spending large parts of each year on exhaustive road trips to taverns throughout rural British Columbia and Alberta. By the late 1970s and into the mid 1980s he was appearing as a sideman with artists such as Albert Collins, Doug and the Slugs, the Coasters, the Platters, the Temptations, and Buddy Knox. In the late 1980s he relocated to Toronto, Canada, and then New York City, working with the bands of Lloyd Williams, Solomon Burke, Danny B, and Kenny Margolis. The 1990s saw Doheny doing extensive touring and studio work, both with jazz ensembles and pop groups, including Bell Biv Devoe.He released his first CD as a leader One Up, Two Back in 2002, featuring his band the John Doheny Quintet, and vocalist Colleen Savage. In 2003 he relocated to New Orleans to pursue a masters degree in jazz history at Tulane University.Doheny is noted as a colorful raconteur (no small accomplishment in a city like New Orleans). A 2002 interview with him can be found here, courtesy of smoothjazz.com, which includes an explanation of how he came to acquire the middle name \"Pip\", and an account of his early days as a struggling musician.Doheny is also a self-made jazz historian. He has written articles on Jelly Roll Morton, and also achieved notoriety for transcribing the music of Charles Mingus from audio form into written musical scores. Having transcribed the music of Mingus, he adapted the scores to a series of performances entitled 'Mingus Mania,' parts of which appeared on the Bravo television network in the early 1990s as musical interludes. Doheny also composed and performed source music for the soundtrack for the 1998 Bruce Sweeney film Dirty, as well as appearing with his band in the 1997 Brian Dennehy TV movie A Father's Betrayal.He is now a resident of New Orleans, Louisiana. While many New Orleans residents were displaced by Hurricane Katrina, Doheny was one of the first to return after the flood waters subsided, and was one of the most enthusiastic and vocal advocates for the rebuilding of New Orleans to its original form, history, and traditions."@en .

He is best remembered for his association with the composer Christoph Willibald Gluck. Legros sang the role of Orpheus at the premiere of the 1774 version of Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice and is usually regarded as the most prominent haute-contres of his generation, though his acting is reputed to have been mediocre.Legros was born at Monampteuil, Laon. After initial training as a choirboy, when his voice broke Legros developed the voice of a haute-contre, a type of French high tenor that was typically used for the heroic male lead in French operas of the period. Legros made his d\u00E9but at the Paris Op\u00E9ra in 1764 and became the leading haute-contre at the Op\u00E9ra, a status he held until his retirement in 1783, caused in part by his increasing obesity.Legros began his operatic career singing the principal roles in the trag\u00E9dies lyriques of Jean-Philippe Rameau. Later, he adapted to the new Italianate style and sang many of the main roles in Gluck's French operas, including Achilles in Iphig\u00E9nie en Aulide, Admetus in the 1776 revision of Alceste, and Renaud in Armide. In 1774 Gluck adapted the role of Orpheus in Orfeo ed Euridice, a part originally sung by the castrato Gaetano Guadagni, for Legros to sing. In this revision, set to a French libretto and retitled Orph\u00E9e et Eurydice, Gluck extended the range of the part of Orpheus to the higher E flat of the treble stave: the part demands a particularly high tessitura and a large range. He also created roles in three operas by Niccol\u00F2 Piccinni, including the role of Pylades in the composer's Iphig\u00E9nie en Tauride. His final role was the title role in Antonio Sacchini's Renaud.From 1777 Legros directed the Concert Spirituel, where he promoted performances of the music of Haydn and Mozart. He collaborated with L.-B. Desormery to rewrite the second act of Fran\u00E7ois Lupien Grenet's op\u00E9ra-ballet Le triomphe de l'harmonie. Their work was performed at the Op\u00E9ra in 1775 under the title Hylas et Egl\u00E9. During this time he also composed an unperformed opera, Anacr\u00E9on, and some songs.

His father was the piano teacher Eduard Conus (ru), and his brothers were the composer and music teacher Georgi Conus and pianist Lev Conus. All three studied at Moscow Conservatory under Sergei Taneyev and Anton Arensky, and all three stayed on to teach there.In 1888 he won the Gold Medal at the Moscow Conservatory. He then studied in Paris, where he played the violin in the Opera orchestra and was a virtuoso in his own right for several years. In 1891, he became a concertmaster in New York City. From 1893 to 1901, he taught violin at the Moscow Conservatory and formed a close friendship with Sergei Rachmaninoff. One of his notable students was violinist, composer, and conductor Alexander Chuhaldin. He also gave concerts, both as a soloist and as a chamber musician, appearing sometimes in a Trio or other ensemble with Rachmaninoff to play the latter's works. (Rachmaninoff dedicated his Two Pieces for Violin and Piano, op. 6, to Julius, and the two men remained close friends throughout their lives.)Conus had two sons, Serge and Boris. (Boris married Rachmaninoff's daughter Tatiana in 1932, and together they had a son the following year.) After the October Revolution, Conus moved to Paris in 1919 with his brother Lev, and began to teach at the Russian Conservatory there in 1921. However as the Nazi threat spread across Europe, Lev emigrated to the US in 1935, and in 1939 Julius returned to Russia. Julius Conus died in Moscow, at Melenki on 3 January 1942.Besides pedagogical works, Conus was known for his adeptness at long-lined melody, as shown particularly in his Violin Concerto in E minor which he premiered in Moscow in 1898 when he was 29 years old. An effective showpiece, it became a repertoire staple in Russia and was long popular with audiences, although it was dismissed by critics. Conus, a violinist himself, wrote no other major work, although he did produce several shorter pieces for violin, which are mostly unplayed today.In the early 1900s Fritz Kreisler championed the concerto, giving its first performance in London (1904). However it was Jascha Heifetz who was to become the Concerto's true champion. He included it in his worldwide concert repertoire, and from 1920 played it many times in Carnegie Hall. He also recorded it with the RCA Symphony Orchestra under Izler Solomon in 1952."@en .

He released the album Enas Rebetis.According to the surviving relatives of famous rebetissa Marika Ninou, in an interview with Panos Geramanis on radio in late 2004, Marika Ninou was the one who discovered, hence the first singer to record \"To Vouno\", one of the last songs recorded by Ninou, prior to her untimely death. The Keti Grei version was issued a short while later and became very popular.Loukas Daralas' recordings were few. There were only two official releases on the now defunct Sonora label. The first being Enas Rebetis, which included his own rendition of \"To Vouno\". The LP was a compilation of his own songs and 11 other pieces. A follow up LP was released a year later in 1975.

The two met when the future Frederick II was still in prison for having attempted to run off with his former companion, Hans Hermann von Katte. At the time, Fredersdorf was four years older than the heir to the throne.Both contemporaries and historians have speculated that Fredersdorf and Frederick II had a homosexual relationship, yet there is no definitive proof. Voltaire would later describe the relationship in his Memoires as, \"This soldier, young, handsome, well made, and who played the flute, served to entertain the prisoner in more than one fashion.\" Frederick named Fredersdorf his valet, then director of the royal theatre, and eventually chancellor of Prussia. This last move shocked Prussian snobs, as Fredersdorf had been the heir of a peasant and the title of chancellor brought with it an estate.Fredersdorf eventually sought to marry, a move which disenchanted the king. Frederick wrote him, \"Have your marriage ceremony today rather than tomorrow if that will contribute to your care and comfort; and if you want to keep a little page and a little scout with you as well, do so.\""@en .

The work was premiered at City Hall, Sheffield, by the Hall\u00E9 Orchestra conducted by Barbirolli, on 14 January 1944, which would have been Heming's 24th birthday. In 1945 Barbirolli recorded the piece on HMV with the Hall\u00E9 Orchestra.

He studied at the Moscow Conservatory and emigrated to the United States in 1893.In 1903 Altschuler organized the Russian Symphony Orchestra Society of New York, which for two decades toured the United States featuring performances and compositions by leading contemporary Russians. Among the Orchestra's notable premieres were Sergei Prokofiev Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 1 in D-flat major, Op. 10, which was performed at Carnegie Hall in New York on December 10, 1918 and Mussorgsky's Prelude to Khovanshchina, which Altschuler presented at Carnegie Hall on February 25, 1905. The Orchestra was among the first established orchestral ensembles to record for the gramophone; Columbia discs of short pieces by Tchaikovsky, Eduard Lassen and others date from about 1910. Nathaniel Shilkret, a member of the Orchestra, notes in his autobiography that soloists in the Orchestra included Mischa Elman, Josef Lhevinne, Sergei Rachmaninoff, and Vassily Safanov. Shilkret also noted that the Orchestra \"played for the great ballerina Pavlova and her partner Mordkin [1910].\"Despite his rigorous classical training, Altschuler was not averse to modernist experimentation. The Symphony's March 1915 New York premiere of Alexander Scriabin's Promethee: Le Poeme de Feu (Prometheus: The Poem of Fire) with Marguerite Volavy as pianist, featured a newly invented device, the chromola, which rendered musical tones in color [1]. After disbanding the orchestra on the eve of the first World War, Altschuler moved to California, where he built a notable reputation as a teacher and performer. With help from his brother, film executive Joe Aller, he composed and performed in film scores, including The Sea Hawk (1924), Dawn to Dawn (1933), It's All in Your mind (1938), Buffalo Bill Rides Again (1947), and Song of My Heart (1948), He was also active in southern California's musical community. In 1926, he organized the Glendale Symphony Orchestra [2].Altschuler founded a musical dynasty which includes his niece Eleanor Aller, his grand-nephew symphony conductor Leonard Slatkin, cellist Frederick Zlotkin, violinist Judith Aller, singer/songwriter Jody Cormack and composer Dylan Mattingly. Aller and her husband Felix Slatkin were principals in the Hollywood String Quartet one of America's most accomplished classical ensembles in the period 1947-1961.

His tunes were often serious and thought-provoking, hardly palatable, though, for the young and old pop music lovers who admired stage and special event performers, such as Viguen and a host of others. Nouri held his chosen career in such high esteem and refused to be ranked among pop singers who were mushrooming during 60's and 70's perhaps because he observed how they often stooped to degradation that ordinarily money and fame imposed on the arts, not to mention hasty fast buck lyrics.
