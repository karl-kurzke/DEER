Both he and his brother showed an interest in music in their young lives. At 5, he began to play the Spanish guitar and at 12 he started his first band called \u201CPrisma\u201D, with Toti Arboles and Eduardo Benavente, both of whom would later make up the core of the sociocultural movement that took place in Spain after Franco\u2019s death, known as the \u201CMovida Madrile\u00F1a\u201D.After playing in several different bands in his early teens, Nacho formed \u201CMecano\u201D with his brother Jose and his brother\u2019s friend Ana Torroja.
