<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ortega_(grape)>	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Ortega is a grape variety used for white wine. It was created in 1948 by Hans Breider at the Bayerischen Landesanstalt f\u00FCr Wein-, Obst- und Gartenbau in W\u00FCrzburg and was released with varietal protection in 1981. It is a cross between M\u00FCller-Thurgau and Siegerrebe. Breider chose to name the variety in honour of the Spanish poet and philosopher Jos\u00E9 Ortega y Gasset.Ortega ripens early, is not sensitive to frost and reaches quite high must weights, typically 20 degrees Oechsle higher than M\u00FCller-Thurgau. It is therefore often used for sweet wines, which are considered to improve with cellaring. Ortega wines have aromas of Muscat and peach and are high in extract.Ortega is also used as a table grape.In 2006, there were 686 hectares (1,700 acres) of Ortega in Germany, with a decreasing tendency. It is also found in England."@en .
