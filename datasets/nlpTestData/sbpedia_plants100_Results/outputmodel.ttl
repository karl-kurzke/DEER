Guettarda argentea provides edible fruit. The type species for the genus is Guettarda speciosa. It is a tree of coastal habitats, up to 18 m (59 ft) in height. It is grown as an ornamental.Guettarda was named by Linnaeus in 1753 in his book Species Plantarum. This generic name is in honour of the 18th century French naturalist Jean-Étienne Guettard.The genus Guettarda is much in need of revision.

There are however several other varieties which are the offspring of Roter Veltliner, such as: Frühroter Veltliner, a cross with Silvaner Neuburger, another cross with Silvaner Rotgipfler, a cross with Traminer Zierfandler, possibly a cross with TraminerDespite its name Roter Veltliner is not related to Grüner Veltliner. It was previously believed that Roter Veltliner could be a grandparent to Grüner Veltliner, but that hypothesis seems to have lost credibility with later studies."@en ;

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cotyledon_(genus)>
        <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/abstract>
                "Cotyledon is a genus of the Crassulaceae family. Plants in the genus occur in the Arabian peninsula and throughout the drier parts of Africa, but mainly in Southern Africa. Members of the genus are shrublets, generally succulent, with fleshily woody, brittle stems and persistent succulent leaves. The leaves are opposite. Leaf pairs generally are oriented at 90 degrees to their preceding and following pairs, as is common in the family Crassulaceae, but the leaf habit differs from say Tylecodon in which the leaves are borne in spirals and are deciduous. The flowers are pendulous and tubular, borne at the tips of stout, rather long peduncles, mainly in short cymes. Calyx 5-partite, corolla 5-lobed. Petals united in a tube or urn that generally is longer than broad, their triangular tips more or less pointed and recurved, 10 stamens arising from corolla near base and projecting or nearly projecting from the corolla. Gynoecium comprises 5 carpels, nearly or quite free, each carpel tapering into a slender style with an obliquely capitate stigma. Each carpel contains many small (typically less than 1 milligramme when ripe) globular, brown seeds.Until the 1960s there were about 150 species described as being in the genus Cotyledon. However, since then it has been split into at least Adromischus, Dudleya, Rossularia, and Tylecodon, leaving probably less than two dozen species in Cotyledon. Of these, about four are characteristically fynbos plants.Most plants in the genus, as well as those that formerly were included in the genus Cotyledon, are poisonous, even dangerously poisonous. Some have been implicated in stock losses among goats, pigs and poultry. However, many species have long been used in traditional medicine. They have been applied for many purposes, ranging from magic charms to removal of corns (allegedly successfully). One thing that is clear is that the species vary in their activity, ranging from allegedly edible to deadly, so it is best to regard all species as dangerous until otherwise demonstrated. As succulents go, Cotyledon spp. certainly are rewarding garden and indoor subjects, practically independent of irrigation in all but full desert conditions, though they cannot survive poor light or bad drainage in the wet. Their main enemies are sucking bugs, members of the suborder Auchenorrhyncha such as the mealy bug (Pseudococcus) and similar insects. Though not spectacular, they are elegantly decorative and often interesting in shape. The inflorescences of the larger species often make fine components of dried arrangements in floral design. Species include: Cotyledon adscendens Cotyledon barbeyi Cotyledon campanulata Cotyledon cuneata Cotyledon chrysantha Cotyledon elisae Cotyledon galpinii Cotyledon orbiculata – Pig's Ear, Round-Leafed Navel-Wort Cotyledon papilaris Cotyledon tomentosa - Bear's Paw Cotyledon undulata - Silver Crown, Silver Ruffles Cotyledon velutina Cotyledon woodii↑ ↑ 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9 ↑ ↑"@en ;

                "Rondo is a dark-skinned grape variety, used for making red wine. It is a hybrid grape or inter-specific crossing. It was created in 1964 by Professor V. Kraus in then-Czechoslovakia by crossing the varieties Zarya Severa (a hybrid which has Vitis amurensis in its pedigree) and St. Laurent. He offered it to Dr. Helmut Becker (1927-1990) of the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute who conducted further work on it, which explains why the grape is known under a Geisenheim designation. The variety has been protected since 1997.This very early maturing variety possesses high resistance against winter frost and downy mildew from its Asiatic Vitis amurensis parent. However annual treatments against powdery mildew may still be necessary in the vineyards. Rondo produces a ruby-red wine which is also used for blending. Rondo is cultivated in many locations in northern Europe where dark-skinned Vitis vinifera varieties are difficult to ripen properly, as it tends to yield good colour and aroma even in those locations. Rondo is cultivated in Rheinhessen and in many locations in northern Europe including Denmark, England, Ireland, the Netherlands and Sweden.In 2011 the British winery Denbies picked up a gold prize in the International Wine Challenge for their 2010 vintage Chalk Ridge Rose, a wine made entirely from Rondo grapes."@en .

The same species is also known by the names Cyrtosperma lasioides, Cyrtosperma chamissonis and Cyrtosperma edule.In the harsh atoll environments of the Central Pacific, especially Tuvalu and Kiribati, swamp taro is an important source of carbohydrates in a diet dominated by fish and coconut. Its cultivation is difficult and time consuming and the plant has deep cultural as well as practical significance. The roots need to be cooked for hours to reduce toxicity in the corms, but are rich in nutrients, especially calcium. The cultivation of Pulaka in Tuvalu, and babai in Kiribati, is an important cultural and culinary tradition, now under threat from rising sea level and displacement from the growing use of imported food products."@en .

                "Eustoma, a genus of three species in the family Gentianaceae, grows natively in warm regions of the Southern United States, Mexico, Caribbean and northern South America. Examples grow mostly in grassland and in areas of disturbed ground. These flowers are commonly known as Lisianthus flowers.They are herbaceous annuals, growing to 15 – 60 cm tall, with bluish green, slightly succulent leaves and large funnel-shaped flowers growing on long straight stems: sometimes erect single stems, other times growing on branching stems that can rise to be three feet tall. The flowers can grow up to two inches across and can be found in a variety of colors. They have been found in all shades of pink, purple, white, and blue. In addition, some are bicolored and some are occasionally found in yellow or carmine-red.Lisianthus flowers are either single-flowered or double-flowered. Both types of flowers can be found in all ranges of the possible colors listed above.They are usually one to three feet tall, although there are dwarf varieties that only grow up to eight inches in height. Lisianthus flowers are tricky to grow and require some maintenance. They have tiny seeds that must be sown on the surface, not buried, and they must be planted in rich, well-drained soil and exposed to full sun. They must be kept moist but not overwatered: overwatering may result in the growth and development of fungal diseases. Lisianthus flowers will begin to bloom in early summer and some will continue to bloom throughout the later months of the summer. When cut, Lisianthus flowers can last anywhere from two to three weeks in a vase.Eustoma russellianum is particularly popular and has a number of cultivars that are grown for the cut-flower market. The cultivated flower is also often known as Lisianthus, Texas Bluebell, Prairie Gentian, Tulip Gentian, or just Gentian, although the last name can cause confusion with the related Gentian plant genus. Eustoma is named after the Greek words eu, which means beautiful, and stoma, which means mouth. Lisianthus on the other hand comes from the Greek words lysis, meaning dissolution, and anthos, which means flower."@en ;

It contains two species of shrubs: Pineda incana, which is native to the Andes of Ecuador and Peru, and Pineda ovata, which is native to the Andes of Bolivia.Pineda is unique among Salicaceae in that the species have 4-5 sepals and petals, hermaphroditic flowers, receptacular disk glands (=nectaries), and outer filamentous staminodes. It is one of few genera of Salicaceae that occur at high elevations. Formerly placed in the heterogeneous family Flacourtiaceae, Pineda is now classified in tribe Prockieae of Salicaceae, along with close relatives Prockia, Banara, Hasseltiopsis, and Neosprucea.Pineda was named in honor of Antonio Pineda, a Guatemalan botanist who was coordinator of the naturalists aboard the Pacific expedition of Alessandro Malaspina.Pineda incana is known as \"lloqui,\" \"lloque,\" \"lloquecillos,\" or \"manzanitas cimarronas,\" and Pineda ovata is known as \"duraznillo.\" Pineda ovata is commonly misidentified as Prockia crucis (Salicaceae)."@en ;

It is known only in cultivation. The species name, pubescens, means hairy, which refers to the hairy leaves of this pepper. The hairiness of the leaves, along with the black seeds, distinguish this species from others. As they reach a relatively advanced age and the roots lignify quickly, sometimes they are called tree chili. Of all the domesticated species of peppers, this is the least widespread and systematically furthest away from all others. It is reproductively isolated from other species of the genus Capsicum. A very notable feature of this species is its ability to withstand cooler temperatures than other cultivated pepper plants, but cannot withstand frost."@en ;

It is closely related to the European Quince genus Cydonia, but one notable difference is the serrated leaves.In China, the species is called \"mugua\", while in Korea, it is called \"mogwa\" (hangul: 모과; Chinese/hanja: 木瓜 - not to be confused with \"papaya\", whose Chinese transliteration is also called 木瓜) which is used for medicine or for making beverages.In Japan, it is known as \"karin - 花梨\" (花 - a flower, 梨 - a pear of an Asian round variety that is called \"nashi\").It grows to 10–18 m tall, with a dense, twiggy crown. The leaves are alternately arranged, simple, 6–12 cm long and 3–6 cm broad, and have a serrated margin. The flowers are 2.5–4 cm diameter, with five pale pink petals; flowering is in mid spring.

                "Prumnopitys andina (Lleuque), the Chilean plum yew, is an evergreen coniferous tree native to south-central Chile and a few areas in adjacent parts of westernmost Argentina from 36 to 40° South latitude. It lives on moderately wet soils preferable on Andean slopes from 500–1100 meters (1600–3500 ft).It grows up to 30 m (100 ft) high, with a trunk up to 2 m diameter (6.5 ft). The leaves are linear to sickle-shaped, 15–30 mm long and 2 mm broad. The seed cones are highly modified, reduced to a central stem 2–4 cm long bearing 1-4 scales, each scale maturing berry-like, oval, 10–15 mm long and 10 mm broad, green maturing dark purple, with a soft edible pulp covering the single seed. The seeds are dispersed by birds, which eat the 'berries' and pass the seeds in their droppings. Seeds are very difficult to germinate. Straight and cylindrical trunk. Gray and shine bark.Before the genus Prumnopitys was distinguished, it was treated in the related genus Podocarpus as Podocarpus andinus. It has also been treated by some botanists as Prumnopitys spicata (Molloy & Muñoz-Schick 1999); however this name is illegitimate (Mill & Quinn 2001). Prumnopitys elegans (Phil) is a synonym for Prumnopitys andina.The fruit (an Aril) are tasty, 1.5 cm (0.6 in) long, blue-purple color and are eaten by Native American people in Chile, and a marmalade is produced with them. The tree is also occasionally grown as an ornamental tree and a hedge in oceanic climate areas in northwest Europe and the Pacific Northwest of North America. In these areas, it is also sometimes known as \"Plum-yew\" or \"Plum-fruited Yew\", though these names are more commonly applied to plants in the genus Cephalotaxus (Cephalotaxaceae).Wood: yellowish color and has a good quality, used in furniture and construction.Evidence suggests that very little regeneration is occurring to replace current ageing trees in populations.

It was created in 1948 by Hans Breider at the Bayerischen Landesanstalt für Wein-, Obst- und Gartenbau in Würzburg and was released with varietal protection in 1981. It is a cross between Müller-Thurgau and Siegerrebe. Breider chose to name the variety in honour of the Spanish poet and philosopher José Ortega y Gasset.Ortega ripens early, is not sensitive to frost and reaches quite high must weights, typically 20 degrees Oechsle higher than Müller-Thurgau. It is therefore often used for sweet wines, which are considered to improve with cellaring. Ortega wines have aromas of Muscat and peach and are high in extract.Ortega is also used as a table grape.In 2006, there were 686 hectares (1,700 acres) of Ortega in Germany, with a decreasing tendency. It is also found in England."@en ;

                "Räuschling is a white variety of grape used for wine. It is today almost only found in small amounts in German-speaking parts of Switzerland, where Räuschling can produce fruity, crisp white wines with good acidity. Räuschling has previously been much more common in Switzerland, Germany and Alsace. Before the widespread planting of Müller-Thurgau, Räuschling and Elbling were the most common grape varieties in Switzerland. German plantations were found in Franconia, Palatinate and Württemberg, as well as in Baden in medieval times. It is also thought to have been the grape variety of the early wines traded from Tramin, with Großer Traminer being one of its synonyms.The name of the variety is supposed to derive from the robust leaf canopy of Räuschling vines which make noise - \"rauschen\" in German - in strong wind. However, the name Reuschling first appeared in the vineyard ordnance (Weingartordnung) issued in 1614 by Count Philipp Ernst zu Hohenlohe-Neuenstein. In the herbals written by Hieronymus Bock in the 16th century, it is referred to as Drutsch or Drutscht.The name Großer Räuschling has been used to differentiate it from the variety Knipperlé, which was previously common in Alsace and which is also called Kleiner Räuschling. Räuschling and Knipperlé are thought to be closely related.DNA profiling has revealed Räuschling to be a cross between Gouais blanc (Weißer Heunisch) and a vine of the Pinot family."@en .

It is a shrub or small tree growing to 6 m tall, with sharp, 3–6 cm long stem spines in the leaf axils. The leaves are alternately arranged, simple broad lanceolate, 5–10 cm long and 1–3 cm broad, with an entire or finely toothed margin.The flowers are inconspicuous, solitary or clustered, with no petals. It is dioecious, with male and female flowers on separate plants, though some female plants are parthenogenetic.The fruit is an edible dark purple globose berry 2–3 cm diameter, very juicy with an acidic flavour, and containing several small seeds. Kitembilla fruit, which taste similar to a gooseberry (they are sometimes called \"Ceylon Gooseberry\"), are often eaten fresh, or made into jam. Some cultivars have been selected for being thornless (making harvesting easier) and larger fruit."@en ;
