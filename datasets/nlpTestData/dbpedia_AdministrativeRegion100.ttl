The diocese comprises the 21,400 square kilometres encompassing the City and Island of Montreal, the Laurentians, the South Shore opposite Montreal, and part of the Eastern Townships. The See city is Montreal, and the cathedral is Christ Church. The diocese maintains approximately 9,000 on its parish rolls in about seventy parishes.The diocese was established in 1850, having been carved off from the Diocese of Quebec. The first synod was organised nine years later. Its first bishop, Francis Fulford, was influenced by the Oxford Movement, and the diocese historically held a generally Anglo-Catholic or high church orientation. Today, like the Anglican Church of Canada generally, liberal theology dominates, with the bishop approving a form for blessings for same-sex unions in 2010.While Montreal was the largest Canadian city and the centre of commerce in the country, the diocese thrived. In recent decades, however, as these attributes have shifted to Toronto, the English-Canadian population in the diocese has shrunk dramatically, forcing the merger and the closure of parishes. The diocese's original membership of 25,000 150 years ago has shrunk by over one-third, even as the total population in the civil region has expanded from about 70,000 to over 3,000,000\u2014a 9000% decrease in its proportional importance.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delegate,_New_South_Wales>	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Delegate is a small town in New South Wales, Australia in Bombala Shire, 523 kilometres (325 mi) south of the state capital, Sydney.Delegate lies just a few kilometres from the state border between New South Wales and Victoria. At the 2006 census, Delegate had a population of 306 people. The township of Delegate lies on the Delegate River.The place name, Delegate, could have derived from an aboriginal word meaning \"high mountains\". The first village began in 1852 and was situated at Hayden's Bog on the property now called \"Bendolba\". Mount Delegate, or commonly known in the local area as \"Delegate Hill\", is situated across the border in Victoria and stands at approx 1325 metres above sea level. It is the only single mountain in the Great Divide and of an unusual shape. Because of its height, Mount Delegate now has several telecommunication towers servicing vital services to both NSW & Victoria.The Delegate area was settled by Europeans in the 1820s when Charles Campbell, youngest son of Robert Campbell of Duntroon, directed that \"some of the shepherds move their animals towards the areas of the winter snows. They trekked, probably via Cooma, and settled a large number of stock in an area where they formed a new station. This the Campbells called Delegate. the stock spread over a large area and, as there was no other occupant of the district, 34,000 acres were annexed to the occupation of Robert Campbell, who later bought this property. Subsequently, while there were still no other serious competitors in the vicinity, Campbell's stock occupied a further 21,000 acres which came to be called Mt Cooper.\" Following Robert Campbell's death the property at Delegate passed to his unmarried daughter, Sophia and from her to her nephews, John and Fredrick Jeffreys.In 1870 a petition was forwarded to the Council of Education to request educational facilities at Craigie, Corrowong and Delegate. In 1871 Delegate Public School was opened. Today Delegate Public School serves a community of children whose parents are farmers, professional people, those employed by the timber industry and others who work locally. The geographical location of Delegate Public School enables it to draw students from both New South Wales and Victoria. The first place of worship on the Monaro (also known as Maneroo) district was the \"Deligat\" chapel. It was a slab building thatched with grass and stood on the bank of Church Creek and was of the Church of England denomination, now known as the Anglican Church of Australia. The site is identified in the Delegate Cemetery and marked by a shelter built during the 1988 Bicentennial Year. In October 1880 St Philip's Anglican Church in Heyden Street was licensed and consecrated in 1885. The Anglican Rectory was dedicated in 1938. In March 1978 the Anglican Parishes of Delegate and Bombala amalgamated to become the Parish of the Southern Monaro.The original Catholic Church in Church Street, the street being appropriately named because of the church, was built in 1877 and in 1915 the present St Joseph's Catholic Church was built on the same site. The Catholic Parish of Delegate also includes St Peter's Corrowong west of Delegate. In 1921 the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart (St Mary (MacKillop) of the Cross Order known as the \"Brown Josephites\") opened a school in Delegate which was first conducted in the church building. Sister Rodriguez and Sister Josephine, who in later years became Mother General of the Josephite Order, opened the school with 25 boys and 16 girls on the roll. The nuns first lived in Craigie Street on the site of the now Delegate Multi Purpose Service. A house was then purchased in Church Street for the nuns as a Convent and an adjacent outbuilding served as the school. In 1943 a new school building was constructed in the church grounds. The Sisters raised their school to make secondary education available to the people of Delegate. With the introduction of the Wyndham Scheme and bus transport the Secondary section closed in 1963. When the Presbytery closed in 1973 the Convent was sold and the nuns moved into the Presbytery and hence it became the new St Joseph's Convent. With the low numbers of Sisters to teach and an enrolment of only 33 pupils, St Joseph's Convent School closed in 1981. In 2013 the Catholic Parish of Bombala/Delegate still own and maintain the Church, Convent and School buildings and the Josephite Order located in Bombala still uphold a wonderful contribution to the Delegate Community.St Andrew's Presbyterian Church was opened in 1878. The Church was built by William Moore and originally had a shingle roof which was replaced by an iron roof in 1912. The original organ was installed in 1901 and the bell in the church grounds was erected in 1905. Families prominent in the Church's history are the Campbells, Rankins, Olivers, Sivewrights, Martins and others of Scotch ancestry. As numbers of Presbyterians diminished over the years the Church was sold in 2009.
