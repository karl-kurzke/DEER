dbpedia:Ixia	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"The genus Ixia consists of a number of cormous plants native to South Africa from the Iridaceae family and Ixioideae subfamily. Some of them are known as the corn lily. Some distinctive traits include: sword-like leaves, and long wiry stems with star-shaped flowers. It usually prefers well-drained soil. The popular corn lily has specific, not very intense fragrance as vegetables. That is why it's often visited by many insects such as bees. The Ixia are also used sometimes as ornamental plants.The genus name is derived from the Greek words ixias, meaning \"the chameleon plant\", and physis, meaning \"bladder\"."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cotyledon_(genus)>	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Cotyledon is a genus of the Crassulaceae family. Plants in the genus occur in the Arabian peninsula and throughout the drier parts of Africa, but mainly in Southern Africa. Members of the genus are shrublets, generally succulent, with fleshily woody, brittle stems and persistent succulent leaves. The leaves are opposite. Leaf pairs generally are oriented at 90 degrees to their preceding and following pairs, as is common in the family Crassulaceae, but the leaf habit differs from say Tylecodon in which the leaves are borne in spirals and are deciduous. The flowers are pendulous and tubular, borne at the tips of stout, rather long peduncles, mainly in short cymes. Calyx 5-partite, corolla 5-lobed. Petals united in a tube or urn that generally is longer than broad, their triangular tips more or less pointed and recurved, 10 stamens arising from corolla near base and projecting or nearly projecting from the corolla. Gynoecium comprises 5 carpels, nearly or quite free, each carpel tapering into a slender style with an obliquely capitate stigma. Each carpel contains many small (typically less than 1 milligramme when ripe) globular, brown seeds.Until the 1960s there were about 150 species described as being in the genus Cotyledon. However, since then it has been split into at least Adromischus, Dudleya, Rossularia, and Tylecodon, leaving probably less than two dozen species in Cotyledon. Of these, about four are characteristically fynbos plants.Most plants in the genus, as well as those that formerly were included in the genus Cotyledon, are poisonous, even dangerously poisonous. Some have been implicated in stock losses among goats, pigs and poultry. However, many species have long been used in traditional medicine. They have been applied for many purposes, ranging from magic charms to removal of corns (allegedly successfully). One thing that is clear is that the species vary in their activity, ranging from allegedly edible to deadly, so it is best to regard all species as dangerous until otherwise demonstrated. As succulents go, Cotyledon spp. certainly are rewarding garden and indoor subjects, practically independent of irrigation in all but full desert conditions, though they cannot survive poor light or bad drainage in the wet. Their main enemies are sucking bugs, members of the suborder Auchenorrhyncha such as the mealy bug (Pseudococcus) and similar insects. Though not spectacular, they are elegantly decorative and often interesting in shape. The inflorescences of the larger species often make fine components of dried arrangements in floral design.

These flowers are commonly known as Lisianthus flowers.They are herbaceous annuals, growing to 15 \u2013 60 cm tall, with bluish green, slightly succulent leaves and large funnel-shaped flowers growing on long straight stems: sometimes erect single stems, other times growing on branching stems that can rise to be three feet tall. The flowers can grow up to two inches across and can be found in a variety of colors. They have been found in all shades of pink, purple, white, and blue. In addition, some are bicolored and some are occasionally found in yellow or carmine-red.Lisianthus flowers are either single-flowered or double-flowered. Both types of flowers can be found in all ranges of the possible colors listed above.They are usually one to three feet tall, although there are dwarf varieties that only grow up to eight inches in height. Lisianthus flowers are tricky to grow and require some maintenance. They have tiny seeds that must be sown on the surface, not buried, and they must be planted in rich, well-drained soil and exposed to full sun. They must be kept moist but not overwatered: overwatering may result in the growth and development of fungal diseases. Lisianthus flowers will begin to bloom in early summer and some will continue to bloom throughout the later months of the summer. When cut, Lisianthus flowers can last anywhere from two to three weeks in a vase.Eustoma russellianum is particularly popular and has a number of cultivars that are grown for the cut-flower market. The cultivated flower is also often known as Lisianthus, Texas Bluebell, Prairie Gentian, Tulip Gentian, or just Gentian, although the last name can cause confusion with the related Gentian plant genus. Eustoma is named after the Greek words eu, which means beautiful, and stoma, which means mouth. Lisianthus on the other hand comes from the Greek words lysis, meaning dissolution, and anthos, which means flower."@en .

dbpedia:Guettarda	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Guettarda is a plant genus in the family Rubiaceae. Most of these plants are known by the common name Velvetseed. Estimates of the number of species range from about 50 to 162. Most of the species are neotropical. Twenty are found in New Caledonia and one reaches Australia. A few others are found on islands and in coastal areas of the Indian and Pacific Oceans.Three species (G. odorata, G. scabra, G. speciosa) are known in cultivation. Guettarda argentea provides edible fruit. The type species for the genus is Guettarda speciosa. It is a tree of coastal habitats, up to 18 m (59 ft) in height. It is grown as an ornamental.Guettarda was named by Linnaeus in 1753 in his book Species Plantarum. This generic name is in honour of the 18th century French naturalist Jean-\u00C9tienne Guettard.The genus Guettarda is much in need of revision. Molecular phylogenetic studies have found it to be several times polyphyletic with some of its clades paraphyletic over small genera."@en .

Breider chose to name the variety in honour of the Spanish poet and philosopher Jos\u00E9 Ortega y Gasset.Ortega ripens early, is not sensitive to frost and reaches quite high must weights, typically 20 degrees Oechsle higher than M\u00FCller-Thurgau. It is therefore often used for sweet wines, which are considered to improve with cellaring. Ortega wines have aromas of Muscat and peach and are high in extract.Ortega is also used as a table grape.In 2006, there were 686 hectares (1,700 acres) of Ortega in Germany, with a decreasing tendency.

It lives on moderately wet soils preferable on Andean slopes from 500\u20131100 meters (1600\u20133500 ft).It grows up to 30 m (100 ft) high, with a trunk up to 2 m diameter (6.5 ft). The leaves are linear to sickle-shaped, 15\u201330 mm long and 2 mm broad. The seed cones are highly modified, reduced to a central stem 2\u20134 cm long bearing 1-4 scales, each scale maturing berry-like, oval, 10\u201315 mm long and 10 mm broad, green maturing dark purple, with a soft edible pulp covering the single seed. The seeds are dispersed by birds, which eat the 'berries' and pass the seeds in their droppings. Seeds are very difficult to germinate. Straight and cylindrical trunk. Gray and shine bark.Before the genus Prumnopitys was distinguished, it was treated in the related genus Podocarpus as Podocarpus andinus. It has also been treated by some botanists as Prumnopitys spicata (Molloy & Mu\u00F1oz-Schick 1999); however this name is illegitimate (Mill & Quinn 2001). Prumnopitys elegans (Phil) is a synonym for Prumnopitys andina.The fruit (an Aril) are tasty, 1.5 cm (0.6 in) long, blue-purple color and are eaten by Native American people in Chile, and a marmalade is produced with them. The tree is also occasionally grown as an ornamental tree and a hedge in oceanic climate areas in northwest Europe and the Pacific Northwest of North America. In these areas, it is also sometimes known as \"Plum-yew\" or \"Plum-fruited Yew\", though these names are more commonly applied to plants in the genus Cephalotaxus (Cephalotaxaceae).Wood: yellowish color and has a good quality, used in furniture and construction.Evidence suggests that very little regeneration is occurring to replace current ageing trees in populations.

It is today almost only found in small amounts in German-speaking parts of Switzerland, where R\u00E4uschling can produce fruity, crisp white wines with good acidity. R\u00E4uschling has previously been much more common in Switzerland, Germany and Alsace. Before the widespread planting of M\u00FCller-Thurgau, R\u00E4uschling and Elbling were the most common grape varieties in Switzerland. German plantations were found in Franconia, Palatinate and W\u00FCrttemberg, as well as in Baden in medieval times. It is also thought to have been the grape variety of the early wines traded from Tramin, with Gro\u00DFer Traminer being one of its synonyms.The name of the variety is supposed to derive from the robust leaf canopy of R\u00E4uschling vines which make noise - \"rauschen\" in German - in strong wind. However, the name Reuschling first appeared in the vineyard ordnance (Weingartordnung) issued in 1614 by Count Philipp Ernst zu Hohenlohe-Neuenstein. In the herbals written by Hieronymus Bock in the 16th century, it is referred to as Drutsch or Drutscht.The name Gro\u00DFer R\u00E4uschling has been used to differentiate it from the variety Knipperl\u00E9, which was previously common in Alsace and which is also called Kleiner R\u00E4uschling. R\u00E4uschling and Knipperl\u00E9 are thought to be closely related.DNA profiling has revealed R\u00E4uschling to be a cross between Gouais blanc (Wei\u00DFer Heunisch) and a vine of the Pinot family."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rondo_(grape)>	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Rondo is a dark-skinned grape variety, used for making red wine. It is a hybrid grape or inter-specific crossing. It was created in 1964 by Professor V. Kraus in then-Czechoslovakia by crossing the varieties Zarya Severa (a hybrid which has Vitis amurensis in its pedigree) and St. Laurent. He offered it to Dr. Helmut Becker (1927-1990) of the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute who conducted further work on it, which explains why the grape is known under a Geisenheim designation. The variety has been protected since 1997.This very early maturing variety possesses high resistance against winter frost and downy mildew from its Asiatic Vitis amurensis parent. However annual treatments against powdery mildew may still be necessary in the vineyards. Rondo produces a ruby-red wine which is also used for blending. Rondo is cultivated in many locations in northern Europe where dark-skinned Vitis vinifera varieties are difficult to ripen properly, as it tends to yield good colour and aroma even in those locations. Rondo is cultivated in Rheinhessen and in many locations in northern Europe including Denmark, England, Ireland, the Netherlands and Sweden.In 2011 the British winery Denbies picked up a gold prize in the International Wine Challenge for their 2010 vintage Chalk Ridge Rose, a wine made entirely from Rondo grapes."@en .
