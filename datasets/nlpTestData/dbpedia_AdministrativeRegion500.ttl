The diocese comprises the 21,400 square kilometres encompassing the City and Island of Montreal, the Laurentians, the South Shore opposite Montreal, and part of the Eastern Townships. The See city is Montreal, and the cathedral is Christ Church. The diocese maintains approximately 9,000 on its parish rolls in about seventy parishes.The diocese was established in 1850, having been carved off from the Diocese of Quebec. The first synod was organised nine years later. Its first bishop, Francis Fulford, was influenced by the Oxford Movement, and the diocese historically held a generally Anglo-Catholic or high church orientation. Today, like the Anglican Church of Canada generally, liberal theology dominates, with the bishop approving a form for blessings for same-sex unions in 2010.While Montreal was the largest Canadian city and the centre of commerce in the country, the diocese thrived. In recent decades, however, as these attributes have shifted to Toronto, the English-Canadian population in the diocese has shrunk dramatically, forcing the merger and the closure of parishes. The diocese's original membership of 25,000 150 years ago has shrunk by over one-third, even as the total population in the civil region has expanded from about 70,000 to over 3,000,000\u2014a 9000% decrease in its proportional importance.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Delegate,_New_South_Wales>	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Delegate is a small town in New South Wales, Australia in Bombala Shire, 523 kilometres (325 mi) south of the state capital, Sydney.Delegate lies just a few kilometres from the state border between New South Wales and Victoria. At the 2006 census, Delegate had a population of 306 people. The township of Delegate lies on the Delegate River.The place name, Delegate, could have derived from an aboriginal word meaning \"high mountains\". The first village began in 1852 and was situated at Hayden's Bog on the property now called \"Bendolba\". Mount Delegate, or commonly known in the local area as \"Delegate Hill\", is situated across the border in Victoria and stands at approx 1325 metres above sea level. It is the only single mountain in the Great Divide and of an unusual shape. Because of its height, Mount Delegate now has several telecommunication towers servicing vital services to both NSW & Victoria.The Delegate area was settled by Europeans in the 1820s when Charles Campbell, youngest son of Robert Campbell of Duntroon, directed that \"some of the shepherds move their animals towards the areas of the winter snows. They trekked, probably via Cooma, and settled a large number of stock in an area where they formed a new station. This the Campbells called Delegate. the stock spread over a large area and, as there was no other occupant of the district, 34,000 acres were annexed to the occupation of Robert Campbell, who later bought this property. Subsequently, while there were still no other serious competitors in the vicinity, Campbell's stock occupied a further 21,000 acres which came to be called Mt Cooper.\" Following Robert Campbell's death the property at Delegate passed to his unmarried daughter, Sophia and from her to her nephews, John and Fredrick Jeffreys.In 1870 a petition was forwarded to the Council of Education to request educational facilities at Craigie, Corrowong and Delegate. In 1871 Delegate Public School was opened. Today Delegate Public School serves a community of children whose parents are farmers, professional people, those employed by the timber industry and others who work locally. The geographical location of Delegate Public School enables it to draw students from both New South Wales and Victoria. The first place of worship on the Monaro (also known as Maneroo) district was the \"Deligat\" chapel. It was a slab building thatched with grass and stood on the bank of Church Creek and was of the Church of England denomination, now known as the Anglican Church of Australia. The site is identified in the Delegate Cemetery and marked by a shelter built during the 1988 Bicentennial Year. In October 1880 St Philip's Anglican Church in Heyden Street was licensed and consecrated in 1885. The Anglican Rectory was dedicated in 1938. In March 1978 the Anglican Parishes of Delegate and Bombala amalgamated to become the Parish of the Southern Monaro.The original Catholic Church in Church Street, the street being appropriately named because of the church, was built in 1877 and in 1915 the present St Joseph's Catholic Church was built on the same site. The Catholic Parish of Delegate also includes St Peter's Corrowong west of Delegate. In 1921 the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart (St Mary (MacKillop) of the Cross Order known as the \"Brown Josephites\") opened a school in Delegate which was first conducted in the church building. Sister Rodriguez and Sister Josephine, who in later years became Mother General of the Josephite Order, opened the school with 25 boys and 16 girls on the roll. The nuns first lived in Craigie Street on the site of the now Delegate Multi Purpose Service. A house was then purchased in Church Street for the nuns as a Convent and an adjacent outbuilding served as the school. In 1943 a new school building was constructed in the church grounds. The Sisters raised their school to make secondary education available to the people of Delegate. With the introduction of the Wyndham Scheme and bus transport the Secondary section closed in 1963. When the Presbytery closed in 1973 the Convent was sold and the nuns moved into the Presbytery and hence it became the new St Joseph's Convent. With the low numbers of Sisters to teach and an enrolment of only 33 pupils, St Joseph's Convent School closed in 1981. In 2013 the Catholic Parish of Bombala/Delegate still own and maintain the Church, Convent and School buildings and the Josephite Order located in Bombala still uphold a wonderful contribution to the Delegate Community.St Andrew's Presbyterian Church was opened in 1878. The Church was built by William Moore and originally had a shingle roof which was replaced by an iron roof in 1912. The original organ was installed in 1901 and the bell in the church grounds was erected in 1905. Families prominent in the Church's history are the Campbells, Rankins, Olivers, Sivewrights, Martins and others of Scotch ancestry.

In 1870, Gu\u00E9rin wrote of Sarona: \"This village is divided into two quarters; the houses are rudely built on two hillocks rising round a valley. This is watered from a spring enclosed in a sort of small square chamber, the floor of which is formed of large slabs, and which has a vaulted vestibule built of regular stones.\"About 10 years later, the Survey of Western Palestine noted \"basaltic stone houses, containing about 250 Moslems, situated in arable plain, without trees.\"In 1878 Sarona was settled by Circassian refugees from the Caucasus, but by 1910 they had moved elsewhere and had been replaced by Arabs. The land was purchased from the Arabs by the Jewish Colonization Association in 1910.In 1913, a Jewish settlement called Rama, but also called Sarona, was established close to the Arab village by ahuza (estate) members from Chicago. The impact of World War I, poor conditions, and the lack of sufficient manpower kept the new settlement improverished and debt-ridden. In 1922, the new and old settlements together contained 77 Arabs but only 15 Jews. In the summer at the end of 1923, additional Jewish settlers, Brisk kevutzah from Kfar Yehezkel, arrived with help from the Jewish National Fund, but by the end of 1928 the settlement had been abandoned and the land returned to the Palestine Jewish Colonization Association, the heir to the Jewish Colonization Association. Half the land was leased to Arab tenants. In 1938 a moshav was established by members of the Gordania organization, with the cost borne by the Palestine Jewish Colonization Association and the Agricultural Workers Federation.

Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Chania, of which it is a municipal unit. It is an important ferry and naval port at the head of Souda Bay.Souda is 6.5 kilometres (4.0 miles) to the east of central Chania, although the area in between is mostly built-up. The town is a relatively new settlement, built on what used to be salt beds and marshland. The Turks knew the area as 'Tuzla', their name for salt-beds. In the 1870s, they began to build a new settlement here which grew as the port expanded. Souda Bay is one of the deepest natural harbours in the Mediterranean and is easy to defend.Now Souda is the arrival point for ferries from Piraeus. There is also a NATO naval base located in Souda and across the bay, with military accommodation and hospital in the town. Much of the command, particularly for US forces, is found across the bay on the Akrotiri. A grain silo overshadows the centre of town. Perhaps because of its nature as a departure point and military town, it is not popular with tourists and can appear seedy and threatening. However it is well-served with shops of all types and some renowned fish restaurants in the old centre. The Allied war cemetery, mostly of soldiers from World War II, is found in Souda on the shore. There are 1,527 graves, mostly British with 447 New Zealanders and 197 Australians. Buried in the cemetery is the archaeologist John Pendlebury. Pendlebury was the curator at Knossos for the British School in Athens and had been continuing excavations in Crete until the war.

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homebush,_Victoria>	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Homebush was a goldmining town 10 kilometres (6 mi) from Avoca in central Victoria, Australia. The locality is within the Pyrenees Shire. First settled in 1853 after a rush to a rich claim nearby, the town reached the height of its prosperity in the 1880s. But Homebush owed its existence entirely to the mines: when the gold ran out and the mines closed the town rapidly declined and died. All that remains of a once-flourishing community is a school building and some mullock heaps.Planned development began in June 1860 when, following a second rush to the diggings, Homebush was surveyed and its streets laid out. Homebush Post Office opened on 1 October 1863 (closing in 1944).Three churches were built, and within little more than a decade. The town opened its railway station, homebush railway station. By 1884 Homebush was firmly established as a business centre, with two agents, a bootmaker, abutcher, two carpenters, two contractors, nine farmers, a gardener, a registrar, a station master, a storekeeper, and a teacher. Lower Homebush, three miles away, where the commercial life of the town had moved closer to some deep-lead mines, had a blacksmith, two bootmakers, a carpenter, a draper, an engineer, two farmers, three hotels, two mining managers, and twelve stores.The rise and decline of Homebush and Lower Homebush can be seen in the history of its schools. In 1861 a Church of England school opened, with classes held in a rented building. Over the next two decades the number of students increased to more than two hundred and two more schools were built, one at Homebush, with another, even bigger, at Lower Homebush. But by 1903 the average attendance at the Lower Homebush school was only forty. Gold yields had dropped and mining companies had ceased operating. Homebush School closed permanently in 1908. Lower Homebush School had small enrolments from the 1930s, and by 1967 it too had closed. By then of course the Homebush School had long gone.In 1883 Vale's Reef mine, one of the district's largest, closed for lack of capital, and over the next decade many other companies also ceased operations. In 1889 hopes revived when the Madame Hopkins Company was formed with a large investment of capital to work an untried deep-lead to the east of Homebush, but this new company was not successful. In 1909 the Excelsior Company opened in Homebush and reputedly yielded rich returns from relatively small quantities of quartz, but by 1920 all large-scale gold mining activity in Avoca shire had ended. The combined population of Homebush and Homebush Lower had fallen to only 150, a huge decline from its peak of 14,000 during the rushes. Businesses closed and buildings were dismantled."@en .
<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indian_Reserve_(1763)>	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"The Indian Reserve is a historical term for a largely uncolonized area in North America ceded by France to Britain following the French and Indian War, set aside in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 for use by American Indians, who already inhabited it.In present-day United States, it consisted of all the territory north of Florida and New Orleans that was east of the Mississippi River and west of the Eastern Continental Divide in the Appalachian Mountains that formerly comprised the eastern half of Louisiana (New France). In modern Canada, it consisted of all the land immediately north of the Great Lakes but south of Rupert's Land belonging to the Hudson's Bay Company, as well as a buffer between the Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791) and Rupert's Land stretching from Lake Nipissing to Newfoundland.Most of the ceded territory had been claimed earlier by France, but the claim was ceded in the Treaty of Paris (1763) that ended the French and Indian War/Seven Years' War. In the Proclamation of 1763, George III organized on paper much of the new territorial gains in three colonies in North America\u2014East Florida, West Florida, and Quebec. The rest of the expanded British territory was left to American Indians. The delineation of the Eastern Divide, following the Allegheny Ridge of the Appalachians, confirmed the limit to British settlement established at the 1758 Treaty of Easton, before Pontiac's War.According to the royal proclamation, all European settlers in the territory (who were mostly French) were supposed to leave the territory or get official permission to stay. Many of the settlers moved to New Orleans and the French land on the west side of the Mississippi (particularly St. Louis), which in turn had been ceded secretly to Spain to become Louisiana (New Spain). However, many of the settlers remained and the British did not actively attempt to evict them.[citation needed]In 1768, lands west of the Alleghenies and south of the Ohio were ceded to the colonies by the Cherokee at the Treaty of Hard Labour and by the Six Nations at the Treaty of Fort Stanwix. However, several other Indian nations, particularly Shawnee and Mingo, continued to inhabit and claim their lands that had been sold to the British by other tribes. This conflict led to Dunmore's War in 1774, ended by the Treaty of Camp Charlotte where these tribes agreed to accept the Ohio River as the new boundary. Restrictions on settlement were to become a flash point in the American Revolutionary War, following the Henderson Purchase of much of Kentucky from the Cherokee in 1775. The renegade Cherokee chief Dragging Canoe did not agree to the sale, nor did the Royal Government in London, which forbade settlement in this region. As an act of Revolution in defiance of the crown, white pioneer settlers began pouring into Kentucky in 1776, opposed by Dragging Canoe in the Chickamauga Wars, which continued until 1794."@en .

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hayden_Island,_Portland,_Oregon>	dbpedia-owl:abstract	"Hayden Island is an island in the Columbia River between Vancouver, Washington and Portland, Oregon. The wide main channel of the Columbia (and the Washington/Oregon state line) passes north of the island. To the south, sheltered by the island, is a smaller channel known as North Portland Harbor. Much of Hayden Island (and connected Tomahawk Island to the east) is within Portland city limits, and recognized as one of its 95 neighborhoods.Interstate 5 provides the only roadway connection to the island, via the northernmost Oregon exit, to the rest of North Portland and, with the Interstate Bridge, to Vancouver to the north. The BNSF Railway crosses North Portland Harbor (via the Oregon Slough Railroad Bridge) and the western part of the island to the west of I-5, before crossing the Columbia via the Burlington Northern Railroad Bridge 9.6. The east end of the island, often called Jantzen Beach, has highly developed retail areas near the freeway, hotels, offices, manufactured home communities, and condominium complexes. Further east there are several houseboat moorages and marinas.Until the Interstate Bridge opened in 1917 ferries provided service between Portland and Vancouver from landings on the island's north shore. After the opening of the bridge, streetcar service opened Hayden Island to amusement park developments due to its beaches and strategic location. Jantzen Beach, the last operating amusement park, closed in 1970. Tomahawk Island, just off the east tip of Hayden Island, became another amusement park\u2014Lotus Isle\u2014for a few years in the 1930s.Because Oregon does not have a state sales tax, and Washington has one of the higher state sales taxes, it is common practice for people in Southwest Washington to travel to Oregon for larger taxable purchases. The Jantzen Beach Shopping Center and many hotels populate this part of the island. A narrow neck of land connects Hayden Island to Tomahawk Island (not an independent island since construction of the linkage), which has numerous marinas and yacht clubs.The west side of the island (in unincorporated Multnomah County) is as yet undeveloped, though it was added to the urban growth boundary by voters in 1983. The Port of Portland purchased the land in 1993 with the intention of building a large cargo facility. Metro, the regional government, has designated West Hayden Island as both high value regionally significant habitat and an industrial land. Environmental activists have successfully blocked annexation for industrial development in 1999. But the Port of Portland renewed efforts to annex West Hayden Island in 2008 and Portland City Council voted July 29, 2010 to go forward with an analysis of annexation that would allow 300 acres (1.2 km2) for an undetermined port facility and preserve the remaining 500 acres (2.0 km2) as a protected natural area."@en .

During the sixties of the twentieth century, the relatively strong demarcation between the Catholic south on one side and the Calvinist west and north on the other side of the Netherlands started to diminish. In the second half of the twentieth century a rapid secularization and strong loss of religious affiliation have taken place in Limburg.Limburg is mostly Roman Catholic by tradition and still uses the term and certain traditions as a base for its cultural identity, though the vast majority of the population is now largely irreligious in practice. Research among Dutch Catholics in 2006 shows that only 27% of the Dutch Catholics can be regarded as a theist, 55% as an ietsist / agnostic theist and 17% as agnostic.Its seat is the Cathedral of St. Christopher in Roermond.

Currently, the Right Reverend John McKee \"Kee\" Sloan serves as diocesan bishop with Santosh Marray serving as assistant bishop. Sloan was elected by the diocese to serve as its 11th bishop on July 16, 2011, and was installed into that office on January 7, 2012, having previously served from 2008 to 2012 as bishop suffragan. The Cathedral Church of the Advent in Birmingham serves as its cathedral. The Bishops' Offices are located at Carpenter House in Birmingham alongside the Church of the Advent, a pre-existing parish that the diocese designated as its cathedral in 1982. The diocese currently includes 92 parishes, including college campus ministries and Camp McDowell, the diocesan camp and conference center, located in Nauvoo, Alabama.The total membership of the diocese is estimated at over 30,000 persons. Alabama is the only diocese in the Episcopal Church where there are no mission congregations; that is, all churches are expected to be self-supporting and self-governing parishes, with diocesan subsidies reserved for new church starts only. The policy was instituted by Bishop Furman C. Stough in the 1970s.Like most of its southern neighbors, the diocese's churchmanship heritage is predominantly of the low variety, reflecting the influence of the founders' origins in places like Virginia and South Carolina. In colonial times, those southern colonies were bastions of evangelical, even Calvinist sentiment among the Anglican clergy and gentry. And like the ECUSA in general, the diocese's members are mostly affluent professionals and businesspeople, often among the wealthiest residents of their respective communities, some of whom have maintained Episcopalian affiliation for several generations. However, these people have largely co-existed peacefully with more liberal parishioners who look upon the Episcopal Church as the primary alternative to the mostly fundamentalist options within Southern Protestantism, particularly in smaller towns, where the diocese has seen some surprising growth, in contrast to national patterns. The Anglican realignment movement among conservatives in protest against the consecration of the openly homosexual bishop Gene Robinson in the 2000s had only a minor impact in Alabama, largely among two Montgomery parishes. This is in decided contrast to other dioceses within the Fourth Province, especially in places like South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas."@en .

The seat of the Viceroyalty was located in Novgorod.The viceroyalty was established by a decree (ukase) of Catherine II on September 5 [O.S. August 24], 1776. It was subdivided into two oblasts: Novgorod and Olonets Oblast. The predecessor of Novgorod Viceroyalty was Novgorod Governorate with the seat in Novgorod. Tver Province which belonged to Novgorod Governorate, was transformed into Tver Viceroyalty, and the rest of the governorate became Novgorod Viceroyalty. Novgorod Oblast included ten uyezds, and, in particular, Kresttsy and Kirillov were chartered to become uyezd towns. Olonets Oblast included five uyezds, and Petrozavodsk was chartered in 1777.As with most of other governorates and viceroyalties established in the 1770s\u20131780s, the establishment of Vologda Viceroyalty was a part of the reform attempting to have a tighter control of local matters by the Russian autocracy. The reform, in turn, was facilitated by the Pugachev's Rebellion of 1774\u20131775.The geographical location of the viceroyalty, which was elongated from south to north, was inconvenient and lead to exchange of lands with neighboring viceroyalties. During this period, Novgorod Viceroyalty bordered with Vologda Viceroyalty in the northeast, Yaroslavl Governorate and Tver Viceroyalty in the south, Pskov Governorate in the west, Saint Petersburg Governorate and Sweden in the northwest. In terms of the modern political division of Russia, Novgorod Viceroyalty in this period comprised the areas of what is currently Novgorod Oblast, Murmansk Oblast, the greater part of the Republic of Karelia, as well as parts of Vologda and Leningrad Oblasts and minor areas of Tver Oblast.On December 11, 1781 Olonets Oblast and Novoladozhsky Uyezd of Novgorod Oblast were transferred from Novgorod Viceroyalty to Saint Petersburg Governorate.After 1781, the viceroyalty consisted of ten uyezds,Novgorodsky Uyezd (with the administrative center located in Novgorod);Belozersky Uyezd (Belozersk);Borovitsky Uyezd (Borovichi);Cherepovetsky Uyezd (Cherepovets);Kirillovsky Uyezd (Kirillov); Krestetsky Uyezd (Kresttsy);Starorussky Uyezd (Staraya Russa);Tikhvinsky Uyezd (Tikhvin);Ustyuzhno-Zheleznopolsky Uyezd (Ustyuzhna);Valdaysky Uyezd (Valday).In 1796, Olonets Viceroyalty was abolished and divided between Novgorod and Arkhangelsk Viceroyalties. After this event, Novgorod Viceroyalty was mentioned in official documents only as Novgorod Governorate."@en .

It is the most popular of all the beaches in the town and the beach curves around the bay until it becomes Main Beach in the nearby township of Merimbula. Next, south past the coastal rocks and cliffs, is Lions Beach. Behind the beach lays Lions Park, a well-used barbecue and picnic area in holiday periods. The approximately 250 meter long beach ends at the mouth of the Pambula River: or The River Mouth. This is the final surfing spot and due to the favorable sand banks in the past, has long been a famous surfing spot in the region.
